1. Data. Only Oracle data is uploaded in this repository. The StackOverFlow data and github data that mentioned in report can be downloaded here: [Github data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jkkr4thw4k2b6mb/Githubdatajava_projects.comm?dl=0) (2.49GB) and [StackOverFlow data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d1xaq8ecoidcb3v/stackdatanew.csv?dl=0) (2.25GB).

2. Models. Three small size models can be used for prediction directly. Due to the file size, this repository does not have trained medium models. You can download  [medium LSTM model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/klny4u7jbsaey85/LSTMmodelckpt.zip?dl=0) (152.9MB) and [medium GRU model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hbha7ifufn509t5/GRUmodelckpt.zip?dl=0) (160.4MB) files and use these trained models for prediction. Google [sequence-to-sequence framework](https://github.com/google/seq2seq) is used in this project for academic purpose.
