Constructor for concrete subclasses to call; uses null for the default value.
Encodes as many characters as possible from the given input buffer, writing the results to the given output buffer. The buffers are read from, and written to, starting at their current positions. At most in.remaining() characters will be read and at most out.remaining() bytes will be written. The buffers' positions will be advanced to reflect the characters read and the bytes written, but their marks and limits will not be modified. In addition to reading characters from the input buffer and writing bytes to the output buffer, this method returns a CoderResult object to describe its reason for termination: CoderResult.UNDERFLOW indicates that as much of the input buffer as possible has been encoded. If there is no further input then the invoker can proceed to the next step of the encoding operation. Otherwise this method should be invoked again with further input. CoderResult.OVERFLOW indicates that there is insufficient space in the output buffer to encode any more characters. This method should be invoked again with an output buffer that has more remaining bytes. This is typically done by draining any encoded bytes from the output buffer. A malformed-input result indicates that a malformed-input error has been detected. The malformed characters begin at the input buffer's (possibly incremented) position; the number of malformed characters may be determined by invoking the result object's length method. This case applies only if the malformed action of this encoder is CodingErrorAction.REPORT; otherwise the malformed input will be ignored or replaced, as requested. An unmappable-character result indicates that an unmappable-character error has been detected. The characters that encode the unmappable character begin at the input buffer's (possibly incremented) position; the number of such characters may be determined by invoking the result object's length method. This case applies only if the unmappable action of this encoder is CodingErrorAction.REPORT; otherwise the unmappable character will be ignored or replaced, as requested. In any case, if this method is to be reinvoked in the same encoding operation then care should be taken to preserve any characters remaining in the input buffer so that they are available to the next invocation. The endOfInput parameter advises this method as to whether the invoker can provide further input beyond that contained in the given input buffer. If there is a possibility of providing additional input then the invoker should pass false for this parameter; if there is no possibility of providing further input then the invoker should pass true. It is not erroneous, and in fact it is quite common, to pass false in one invocation and later discover that no further input was actually available. It is critical, however, that the final invocation of this method in a sequence of invocations always pass true so that any remaining unencoded input will be treated as being malformed. This method works by invoking the encodeLoop method, interpreting its results, handling error conditions, and reinvoking it as necessary.
Creates the menu item's peer. The peer allows us to modify the appearance of the menu item without changing its functionality.
Removes the old window-state-listener from window-state-listener-l and returns the resulting multicast listener.
Replaces the element at the specified position in this list with the specified element.
Paints the specified component. This implementation does nothing.
Returns the model's maximum.
Returns the number of keys in this hashtable.
Constructor that allows a specific error message to be specified.
Returns the refresh rate of the display, in hertz. This may be REFRESH_RATE_UNKNOWN if the information is not available.
Returns the number of accessible children in the object. If all of the children of this object implement Accessible, than this method should return the number of children of this object.
Writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset off to the underlying output stream. If no exception is thrown, the counter written is incremented by len.
"Returns a string representation of this identity, with optionally more details than that provided by the toString method without any arguments. First, if there is a security manager, its checkSecurityAccess method is called with ""printIdentity"" as its argument to see if it's ok to return the string."
Return a string representation of this X500Principal.
Loads an agent library. This convenience method works as if by invoking: loadAgentLibrary(agentLibrary, null);
Refresh and reload the Configuration by re-reading all of the login configurations.
Returns an array of all the ChangeListeners added to this JViewport with addChangeListener().
Commit the authentication (second phase). This method is called if the LoginContext's overall authentication succeeded (the relevant REQUIRED, REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT and OPTIONAL LoginModules succeeded). If this LoginModule's own authentication attempt succeeded (the importing of the Solaris authentication information succeeded), then this method associates the Solaris Principals with the Subject currently tied to the LoginModule. If this LoginModule's authentication attempted failed, then this method removes any state that was originally saved.
Sets the glassPane property. This method is called by the constructor.
Obtains the value associated with a key in a key property.
Creates an instance of ListDataListener that's added to the JLists by model as needed. Subclasses can override this method to return a custom ListDataListener, e.g. class MyListUI extends BasicListUI { protected ListDataListener createListDataListener() { return new MyListDataListener(); } public class MyListDataListener extends ListDataHandler { public void contentsChanged(ListDataEvent e) { // do some extra work when the models contents change super.contentsChange(e); } } }
Gets the BeanContext associated with this event.
Used only by subclasses. Create a TCP server socket on a port, using the default authentication context. The connection backlog defaults to fifty connections queued up before the system starts to reject new connection requests. A port number of 0 creates a socket on any free port. If there is a security manager, its checkListen method is called with the port argument as its argument to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result in a SecurityException.
Paints the specified component according to the Look and Feel. This method is not used by Synth Look and Feel. Painting is handled by the paint(SynthContext,Graphics) method.
Returns the socket address that this channel's socket is bound to. Where the channel is bound to an Internet Protocol socket address then the return value from this method is of type InetSocketAddress. If there is a security manager set, its checkConnect method is called with the local address and -1 as its arguments to see if the operation is allowed. If the operation is not allowed, a SocketAddress representing the loopback address and the local port of the channel's socket is returned.
No connection present.
Tag for unsigned byte data.
Returns true if this lock has fairness set true.
Gets the Font described by this FontMetrics object.
Continues a multiple-part encryption or decryption operation (depending on how this cipher was initialized), processing another data part. The bytes in the input buffer are processed, and the result is stored in a new buffer. If input has a length of zero, this method returns null.
Returns the length of the file denoted by this abstract pathname. The return value is unspecified if this pathname denotes a directory. Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case that 0L is returned, or where several attributes of the same file are required at the same time, then the Files.readAttributes method may be used.
Skips over and discards n bytes of data from the input stream. The skip method may, for a variety of reasons, end up skipping over some smaller number of bytes, possibly 0. If n is negative, the method will try to skip backwards. In case the backing file does not support backward skip at its current position, an IOException is thrown. The actual number of bytes skipped is returned. If it skips forwards, it returns a positive value. If it skips backwards, it returns a negative value. This method may skip more bytes than what are remaining in the backing file. This produces no exception and the number of bytes skipped may include some number of bytes that were beyond the EOF of the backing file. Attempting to read from the stream after skipping past the end will result in -1 indicating the end of the file.
Gets the range of valid values for the specified field. All fields can be expressed as a long integer. This method returns an object that describes the valid range for that value. Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values and it is important not to read too much into them. For example, there could be values within the range that are invalid for the field. This method will return a result whether or not the chronology supports the field.
Construct a BeanContextServiceEvent.
Creates a new SOAPFault object and adds it to this SOAPBody object. The type of the SOAPFault will be a SOAP 1.1 or a SOAP 1.2 SOAPFault depending on the protocol specified while creating the MessageFactory instance. For SOAP 1.2 the faultCode parameter is the value of the Fault/Code/Value element and the faultString parameter is the value of the Fault/Reason/Text element. For SOAP 1.1 the faultCode parameter is the value of the faultcode element and the faultString parameter is the value of the faultstring element. A SOAPBody may contain at most one SOAPFault child element.
Sets whether component visibility is considered when sizing and positioning components. A value of true indicates that non-visible components should not be treated as part of the layout. A value of false indicates that components should be positioned and sized regardless of visibility. A value of false is useful when the visibility of components is dynamically adjusted and you don't want surrounding components and the sizing to change. The specified value is used for components that do not have an explicit visibility specified. The default is true.
Allows an object instance to be created given an object name and the full class name, including the package name.
Whether the progress bar is horizontal or vertical. The default is HORIZONTAL.
Constructs a SQLRecoverableException object with a given reason. The SQLState is initialized to null and the vendor code is initialized to 0. The cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by a call to the Throwable.initCause(java.lang.Throwable) method.
Constructs an empty NameValuePair object. To associate a name with a value after using this constructor, the fields of this object have to be accessed individually.
Creates a directory by creating all nonexistent parent directories first. Unlike the createDirectory method, an exception is not thrown if the directory could not be created because it already exists. The attrs parameter is optional file-attributes to set atomically when creating the nonexistent directories. Each file attribute is identified by its name. If more than one attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but the last occurrence is ignored. If this method fails, then it may do so after creating some, but not all, of the parent directories.
This method sets the state for the supplementary information flags and the minor status in MessageProp. It is not used by the application but by the GSS implementation to return this information to the caller of a per-message context method.
Gets file objects representing the given file names. Convenience method equivalent to: getJavaFileObjectsFromStrings(Arrays.asList(names))
Create a new NotIdentifiableEventImpl.
"Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence (from first to last element). The returned array will be ""safe"" in that no references to it are maintained by this list. (In other words, this method must allocate a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array. This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs."
Reverses configuration which was done on the specified component during installUI. This method is invoked when this UIComponent instance is being removed as the UI delegate for the specified component. This method should undo the configuration performed in installUI, being careful to leave the JComponent instance in a clean state (no extraneous listeners, look-and-feel-specific property objects, etc.). This should include the following: Remove any UI-set borders from the component. Remove any UI-set layout managers on the component. Remove any UI-added sub-components from the component. Remove any UI-added event/property listeners from the component. Remove any UI-installed keyboard UI from the component. Nullify any allocated instance data objects to allow for GC.
Returns a set of types in elements.
Called by RMIServerImpl.close() to close the connector server by unexporting this object. After returning from this method, the connector server must not accept any new connections.
"Normalizes this URI's path. If this URI is opaque, or if its path is already in normal form, then this URI is returned. Otherwise a new URI is constructed that is identical to this URI except that its path is computed by normalizing this URI's path in a manner consistent with RFC 2396, section 5.2, step 6, sub-steps c through f; that is: All ""."" segments are removed. If a "".."" segment is preceded by a non-"".."" segment then both of these segments are removed. This step is repeated until it is no longer applicable. If the path is relative, and if its first segment contains a colon character (':'), then a ""."" segment is prepended. This prevents a relative URI with a path such as ""a:b/c/d"" from later being re-parsed as an opaque URI with a scheme of ""a"" and a scheme-specific part of ""b/c/d"". (Deviation from RFC 2396) A normalized path will begin with one or more "".."" segments if there were insufficient non-"".."" segments preceding them to allow their removal. A normalized path will begin with a ""."" segment if one was inserted by step 3 above. Otherwise, a normalized path will not contain any ""."" or "".."" segments."
Constructs a Rectangle2D of the appropriate precision to hold the parameters calculated to be the framing rectangle of this arc.
Returns a copy of the historical bytes in this ATR. If this ATR does not contain historical bytes, an array of length zero is returned.
"Key stored as a client property to indicate the base that relative references are resolved against. For example, lets say you keep your images in the directory resources relative to the code path, you would use the following the set the base: jComponent.putClientProperty(documentBaseKey, xxx.class.getResource(""resources/""));"
The Any value held by this AnyHolder object.
Constructs a RequiredModelMBean object using ModelMBeanInfo passed in. As long as the RequiredModelMBean is not registered with the MBeanServer yet, the RequiredModelMBean's MBeanInfo and Descriptors can be customized using the setModelMBeanInfo(javax.management.modelmbean.ModelMBeanInfo) method. After the RequiredModelMBean's MBeanInfo and Descriptors are customized, the RequiredModelMBean can be registered with the MBeanServer.
Returns a TransformService that supports the specified algorithm URI (ex: Transform.XPATH2) and mechanism type (ex: DOM) as supplied by the specified provider. Note that the specified Provider object does not have to be registered in the provider list.
Creates a MessageFormat with the given pattern and uses it to format the given arguments. This is equivalent to (new MessageFormat(pattern)).format(arguments, new StringBuffer(), null).toString()
This attribute is used for the identifier of the counter.
Invoked when the user attempts to close the window from the window's system menu.
Writes a single character.
Indicates that the operation is write-like: it has an effect but does not return any information from the MBean.
Sets the transaction isolation level for this RowSet object.
Creates a SynthGraphicsUtils.
This operation returns a naming context implemented by the same naming server as the context on which the operation was invoked. The new context is not bound to any name.
Inserts the given String as the value for this DynAny object. If this method is called on a constructed DynAny object, it initializes the next component of the constructed data value associated with this DynAny object.
"Obtains a clip that can be used for playing back an audio file or an audio stream. The returned clip will be provided by the default system mixer, or, if not possible, by any other mixer installed in the system that supports a Clip object. The returned clip must be opened with the open(AudioFormat) or open(AudioInputStream) method. This is a high-level method that uses getMixer and getLine internally. If the system property javax.sound.sampled.Clip is defined or it is defined in the file ""sound.properties"", it is used to retrieve the default clip. For details, refer to the class description."
Selects the ith menu in the menu. If that item is a submenu, it will pop up in response. If a different item is already popped up, this will force it to close. If this is a sub-menu that is already popped up (selected), this method has no effect.
Analagous to java.lang.ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(), this method allows a BeanContext implementation to interpose behavior between the child Component and underlying ClassLoader.
Returns a string representation of this Thread group.
Return a string describing the access modifier flags in the specified modifier. For example: public final synchronized strictfp The modifier names are returned in an order consistent with the suggested modifier orderings given in sections 8.1.1, 8.3.1, 8.4.3, 8.8.3, and 9.1.1 of The Java™ Language Specification. The full modifier ordering used by this method is: public protected private abstract static final transient volatile synchronized native strictfp interface The interface modifier discussed in this class is not a true modifier in the Java language and it appears after all other modifiers listed by this method. This method may return a string of modifiers that are not valid modifiers of a Java entity; in other words, no checking is done on the possible validity of the combination of modifiers represented by the input. Note that to perform such checking for a known kind of entity, such as a constructor or method, first AND the argument of toString with the appropriate mask from a method like constructorModifiers() or methodModifiers().
Returns an Iterator over all the SOAPHeaderElement objects in this SOAPHeader object that have the specified actor and that have a MustUnderstand attribute whose value is equivalent to true. In SOAP 1.2 the env:actor attribute is replaced by the env:role attribute, but with essentially the same semantics.
Returns the name of the resource. The name is opaque and depends on the type of the resource.
Removes the specified focus listener so that it no longer receives focus events from this component. This method performs no function, nor does it throw an exception, if the listener specified by the argument was not previously added to this component. If listener l is null, no exception is thrown and no action is performed. Refer to AWT Threading Issues for details on AWT's threading model.
Sets the requested data array element in the first (default) bank to the given int.
Overrides FilterInputStream.read to update the progress monitor after the read.
"Get the printing attribute class which is to be used as the ""category"" for this printing attribute value when it is added to an attribute set."
Scan a single node.
Retrieves the contents of this URL connection.
Paints the toolbar.
Performs a lookup operation on a BufferedImage. If the color model in the source image is not the same as that in the destination image, the pixels will be converted in the destination. If the destination image is null, a BufferedImage will be created with an appropriate ColorModel. An IllegalArgumentException might be thrown if the number of arrays in the LookupTable does not meet the restrictions stated in the class comment above, or if the source image has an IndexColorModel.
Retrieves the negotiated property. This method can be called only after the authentication exchange has completed (i.e., when isComplete() returns true); otherwise, an IllegalStateException is thrown.
Returns a copy of the receiver, but with the source being newSource.
Get the SSLSession for this exchange.
Get the standalone declaration from the xml declaration
Specifies the North American Number 12 business envelope size, 4.75 inches by 11 inches.
Invocation handler that can forward methods through an MBean server to a Standard MBean or MXBean. This constructor may be called instead of relying on JMX.newMXBeanProxy, for instance if you need to supply a different ClassLoader to Proxy.newProxyInstance.
Gets the index with the hypertext document at which this link begins
Sets the vertical gap between components.
The name of the file. Normally this would be simply f.getName().
Reads b.length bytes from this file into the byte array, starting at the current file pointer. This method reads repeatedly from the file until the requested number of bytes are read. This method blocks until the requested number of bytes are read, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.
Returns the CompositeData value whose index is key, or null if there is no value mapping to key, in this TabularData instance.
Returns the originator of the event.
Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are greater than (or equal to, if inclusive is true) fromKey. The returned map is backed by this map, so changes in the returned map are reflected in this map, and vice-versa. The returned map supports all optional map operations that this map supports. The returned map will throw an IllegalArgumentException on an attempt to insert a key outside its range.
"Returns a string representation of this preferences node, as if computed by the expression:(this.isUserNode() ? ""User"" : ""System"") + "" Preference Node: "" + this.absolutePath()."
Japanese Double Postcard size.
Return the LayoutPath, or null if the layout path is the default path (x maps to advance, y maps to offset).
Permission to add a new file to a directory (equal to WRITE_DATA)
Obtains the set of master synchronization modes supported by this sequencer.
Get included annotation types in this package.
Construct a new copies supported attribute containing a single range of integers. That is, only those values of Copies in the one range are supported.
Indicates a vertical layout of cells, in a single column; the default layout.
Checks if this date-time is equal to the specified date-time. This checks to see if this date-time represents the same point on the local time-line as the other date-time. LocalDate a = LocalDateTime.of(2012, 6, 30, 12, 00); LocalDate b = LocalDateTime.of(2012, 7, 1, 12, 00); a.isEqual(b) == false a.isEqual(a) == true b.isEqual(a) == false This method only considers the position of the two date-times on the local time-line. It does not take into account the chronology, or calendar system. This is different from the comparison in compareTo(ChronoLocalDateTime), but is the same approach as ChronoLocalDateTime.timeLineOrder().
Removes a listener for table column model events.
Retrieves the designated parameter's number of digits to right of the decimal point. 0 is returned for data types where the scale is not applicable.
Constructs a new GeneralPath object with the specified winding rule to control operations that require the interior of the path to be defined.
Field number for get and set indicating the hour of the morning or afternoon. HOUR is used for the 12-hour clock (0 - 11). Noon and midnight are represented by 0, not by 12. E.g., at 10:04:15.250 PM the HOUR is 10.
Constructs a SQLClientInfoException object initialized with a given failedProperties. The reason and SQLState are initialized to null and the vendor code is initialized to 0. The cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by a call to the Throwable.initCause(java.lang.Throwable) method.
Constructs a new instance of LinkLoopException. All the non-link-related and link-related fields are initialized to null.
"Retrieves the name of the operation being invoked. According to OMG IDL's rules, these names must be unique among all operations supported by this object's ""most-derived"" interface. Note that the operation names for getting and setting attributes are _get_<attribute_name> and _set_<attribute_name>, respectively."
Compares this Method against the specified object. Returns true if the objects are the same. Two Methods are the same if they were declared by the same class and have the same name and formal parameter types and return type.
Writes a portion of a string.
8x10 North American paper.
Returns this encoder's current action for malformed-input errors.
The MediaType instance for North American Letter, 8 1/2 x 11 in.
Invokes the getAccessibleChild method on each UI handled by this object.
Obtains a String describing the control type and its current state.
Returns a parameter string identifying this event. This method is useful for event-logging and for debugging.
Returns the current number of live threads including both daemon and non-daemon threads.
Returns the menu disabled foreground color. This returns the value of getSecondary2().
A transaction branch took too long.
Associates a configured instance of XmlAdapter with this unmarshaller. Every unmarshaller internally maintains a Map<Class,XmlAdapter>, which it uses for unmarshalling classes whose fields/methods are annotated with XmlJavaTypeAdapter. This method allows applications to use a configured instance of XmlAdapter. When an instance of an adapter is not given, an unmarshaller will create one by invoking its default constructor.
Determines is this ticket is post-dated.
Gets the keyboard mnemonic for the button.
Returns a copy of this LocalDate with the specified number of days subtracted. This method subtracts the specified amount from the days field decrementing the month and year fields as necessary to ensure the result remains valid. The result is only invalid if the maximum/minimum year is exceeded. For example, 2009-01-01 minus one day would result in 2008-12-31. This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Constructs an InvalidMidiDataException with null for its error detail message.
Constructs a RadialGradientPaint.
Compares two Character objects numerically.
Constructs an initially invisible, modeless Dialog with the specified owner Dialog and title.
Returns an integer Rectangle that completely encloses the Shape. Note that there is no guarantee that the returned Rectangle is the smallest bounding box that encloses the Shape, only that the Shape lies entirely within the indicated Rectangle. The returned Rectangle might also fail to completely enclose the Shape if the Shape overflows the limited range of the integer data type. The getBounds2D method generally returns a tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in representation. Note that the definition of insideness can lead to situations where points on the defining outline of the shape may not be considered contained in the returned bounds object, but only in cases where those points are also not considered contained in the original shape. If a point is inside the shape according to the contains(point) method, then it must be inside the returned Rectangle bounds object according to the contains(point) method of the bounds. Specifically: shape.contains(x,y) requires bounds.contains(x,y) If a point is not inside the shape, then it might still be contained in the bounds object: bounds.contains(x,y) does not imply shape.contains(x,y)
Returns an object from the defaults.
Destination that receives all events.
Sets the opacity of the window. The opacity value is in the range [0..1]. Note that setting the opacity level of 0 may or may not disable the mouse event handling on this window. This is a platform-dependent behavior. The following conditions must be met in order to set the opacity value less than 1.0f: The TRANSLUCENT translucency must be supported by the underlying system The window must be undecorated (see setUndecorated(boolean) and Dialog.setUndecorated(boolean)) The window must not be in full-screen mode (see GraphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindow(Window)) If the requested opacity value is less than 1.0f, and any of the above conditions are not met, the window opacity will not change, and the IllegalComponentStateException will be thrown. The translucency levels of individual pixels may also be effected by the alpha component of their color (see Window.setBackground(Color)) and the current shape of this window (see Window.setShape(Shape)).
Returns the last access time of the entry. The last access time is from the extended timestamp fields of entry's optional extra data when read from a ZIP file or ZIP file formatted stream.
Removes the last occurrence of the specified element in this list (when traversing the list from head to tail). If the list does not contain the element, it is unchanged.
Called by the RMI runtime sometime after the runtime determines that the reference list, the list of clients referencing the remote object, becomes empty.
Returns the location of the corresponding destination point given a point in the source. If dstPt is specified, it is used to hold the return value.
"Produces a special invoker method handle which can be used to invoke any method handle compatible with the given type, as if by invoke. The resulting invoker will have a type which is exactly equal to the desired type, except that it will accept an additional leading argument of type MethodHandle. Before invoking its target, if the target differs from the expected type, the invoker will apply reference casts as necessary and box, unbox, or widen primitive values, as if by asType. Similarly, the return value will be converted as necessary. If the target is a variable arity method handle, the required arity conversion will be made, again as if by asType. This method is equivalent to the following code (though it may be more efficient): publicLookup().findVirtual(MethodHandle.class, ""invoke"", type) Discussion: A general method type is one which mentions only Object arguments and return values. An invoker for such a type is capable of calling any method handle of the same arity as the general type. (Note: The invoker method is not available via the Core Reflection API. An attempt to call java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke on the declared invokeExact or invoke method will raise an UnsupportedOperationException.) This method throws no reflective or security exceptions."
Sorts the specified range of the array into ascending order. The range to be sorted extends from the index fromIndex, inclusive, to the index toIndex, exclusive. If fromIndex == toIndex, the range to be sorted is empty. Implementation note: The sorting algorithm is a Dual-Pivot Quicksort by Vladimir Yaroslavskiy, Jon Bentley, and Joshua Bloch. This algorithm offers O(n log(n)) performance on many data sets that cause other quicksorts to degrade to quadratic performance, and is typically faster than traditional (one-pivot) Quicksort implementations.
Removes a named style previously added to the document.
Creates the mouse listener for the JTableHeader.
Returns the device configuration associated with this Graphics2D.
Extracts the byte value from this DynAny. The IDL octet data type is mapped to the Java byte data type.
Get the foreground color of this object.
Sets the designated parameter in this RowSet object's command with a Java Object. For integral values, the java.lang equivalent objects should be used. The JDBC specification provides a standard mapping from Java Object types to SQL types. The driver will convert the given Java object to its standard SQL mapping before sending it to the database. Note that this method may be used to pass datatabase-specific abstract data types by using a driver-specific Java type. If the object is of a class implementing SQLData, the rowset should call the method SQLData.writeSQL to write the object to an SQLOutput data stream. If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing Ref, Blob, Clob, NClob, Struct, java.net.URL, or Array, the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the corresponding SQL type. An exception is thrown if there is an ambiguity, for example, if the object is of a class implementing more than one of these interfaces.
Returns the string table for class OrientationRequested.
Creates an empty property list with no default values.
Paints the border of the track of a scrollbar. The track contains the thumb.
Resets the cursor based on the orientation.
Set this Subject to be read-only. Modifications (additions and removals) to this Subject's Principal Set and credential Sets will be disallowed. The destroy operation on this Subject's credentials will still be permitted. Subsequent attempts to modify the Subject's Principal and credential Sets will result in an IllegalStateException being thrown. Also, once a Subject is read-only, it can not be reset to being writable again.
Obtain an instance of a DOMImplementation object.
Adds the specified child Component. This method is overridden to conditionally forward calls to the contentPane. By default, children are added to the contentPane instead of the frame, refer to RootPaneContainer for details.
Returns true if the open data values this open type describes are primitive arrays, false otherwise.
Closes this enumeration. After this method has been invoked on this enumeration, the enumeration becomes invalid and subsequent invocation of any of its methods will yield undefined results. This method is intended for aborting an enumeration to free up resources. If an enumeration proceeds to the end--that is, until hasMoreElements() or hasMore() returns false-- resources will be freed up automatically and there is no need to explicitly call close(). This method indicates to the service provider that it is free to release resources associated with the enumeration, and can notify servers to cancel any outstanding requests. The close() method is a hint to implementations for managing their resources. Implementations are encouraged to use appropriate algorithms to manage their resources when client omits the close() calls.
The width of the source image.
Specifies the bottom edge of a component's bounding rectangle.
An alias for NA_9X12_ENVELOPE.
Formats this year using the specified formatter. This year will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.
Sets the limit for the maximum number of rows that any ResultSet object generated by this Statement object can contain to the given number. If the limit is exceeded, the excess rows are silently dropped. This method should be used when the row limit may exceed Integer.MAX_VALUE. The default implementation will throw UnsupportedOperationException
Start a drag, given the DragGestureEvent that initiated the drag, the initial Cursor to use, the Transferable subject data of the drag, and the DragSourceListener.
Returns the SAX parser that is encapsultated by the implementation of this class.
Initializes this cipher with a key. The cipher is initialized for one of the following four operations: encryption, decryption, key wrapping or key unwrapping, depending on the value of opmode. If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters that cannot be derived from the given key, the underlying cipher implementation is supposed to generate the required parameters itself (using provider-specific default or random values) if it is being initialized for encryption or key wrapping, and raise an InvalidKeyException if it is being initialized for decryption or key unwrapping. The generated parameters can be retrieved using getParameters or getIV (if the parameter is an IV). If this cipher requires algorithm parameters that cannot be derived from the input parameters, and there are no reasonable provider-specific default values, initialization will necessarily fail. If this cipher (including its underlying feedback or padding scheme) requires any random bytes (e.g., for parameter generation), it will get them using the SecureRandom implementation of the highest-priority installed provider as the source of randomness. (If none of the installed providers supply an implementation of SecureRandom, a system-provided source of randomness will be used.) Note that when a Cipher object is initialized, it loses all previously-acquired state. In other words, initializing a Cipher is equivalent to creating a new instance of that Cipher and initializing it.
Returns an unmodifiable list of Transforms of this RetrievalMethod.
Get a utility object for dealing with program elements.
"Returns a String representation of the current progress. By default, this returns a simple percentage String based on the value returned from getPercentComplete. An example would be the ""42%"". You can change this by calling setString."
Returns an enum indicating how the baseline of the component changes as the size changes. This method is primarily meant for layout managers and GUI builders. The default implementation returns BaselineResizeBehavior.OTHER. Subclasses that have a baseline should override appropriately. Subclasses should never return null; if the baseline can not be calculated return BaselineResizeBehavior.OTHER. Callers should first ask for the baseline using getBaseline and if a value >= 0 is returned use this method. It is acceptable for this method to return a value other than BaselineResizeBehavior.OTHER even if getBaseline returns a value less than 0.
Writes next block of compressed data to the output stream.
This method is called when the user wants to close the frame. The playCloseSound Action is fired. This action is delegated to the desktopManager.
Reserved key for a named value that is the name of the ScriptEngine implementation.
Is equivalent to seek(0).
Imports the parameters from params and decodes them according to the specified decoding format. If format is null, the primary decoding format for parameters is used. The primary decoding format is ASN.1, if an ASN.1 specification for these parameters exists.
Sets the selected index for this tabbedpane. The index must be a valid tab index or -1, which indicates that no tab should be selected (can also be used when there are no tabs in the tabbedpane). If a -1 value is specified when the tabbedpane contains one or more tabs, then the results will be implementation defined.
Gets the timer notification type corresponding to the specified identifier.
Returns a boolean indicating whether or not this StreamPrintService has been disposed. If this object has been disposed, will return true. Used by services and client applications to recognize streams to which no further data should be written.
Advances the current position to the next component. The operation returns true while the resulting current position indicates a component, false otherwise. A false return value leaves the current position at -1. Invoking next on a DynAny without components leaves the current position at -1 and returns false.
Gets the name of the DTD.
Returns true if this SimpleTimeZone observes Daylight Saving Time. This method is equivalent to useDaylightTime().
Tests if this GSSCredential asserts the same entity as the supplied object. The two credentials must be acquired over the same mechanisms and must refer to the same principal.
Gets the FontMetrics of this object.
Returns true if this map contains a mapping for the specified key. More formally, returns true if and only if this map contains a mapping for a key k such that (key==null ? k==null : key.equals(k)). (There can be at most one such mapping.)
Returns the action of the performed by the garbage collector
Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of the Shape than the getBounds method. Note that there is no guarantee that the returned Rectangle2D is the smallest bounding box that encloses the Shape, only that the Shape lies entirely within the indicated Rectangle2D. The bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that returned by the getBounds method and never fails due to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of the Rectangle2D that uses double precision values to store the dimensions. Note that the definition of insideness can lead to situations where points on the defining outline of the shape may not be considered contained in the returned bounds object, but only in cases where those points are also not considered contained in the original shape. If a point is inside the shape according to the contains(point) method, then it must be inside the returned Rectangle2D bounds object according to the contains(point) method of the bounds. Specifically: shape.contains(p) requires bounds.contains(p) If a point is not inside the shape, then it might still be contained in the bounds object: bounds.contains(p) does not imply shape.contains(p)
Returns the enumeration value table for class JobSheets.
Gets the zone offset, such as '+01:00'. This is the offset of the local time from UTC/Greenwich.
Constant for the F17 function key.
Retrieves a component of this name.
Creates a view that can be used to represent the current piece of the flow. This can be either an entire view from the logical view, or a fragment of the logical view.
The ImageWriterSpi that instantiated this object, or null if its identity is not known or none exists. By default it is initialized to null.
Value of the AM_PM field indicating the period of the day from noon to just before midnight.
Returns an unmodifiable list of the content in this X509Data. Valid types are String (subject names), byte[] (subject key ids), X509Certificate, X509CRL, or XMLStructure (X509IssuerSerial objects or elements from an external namespace).
"Attempted updates to ""Constrained"" properties will cause a ""VetoableChange"" event to get fired when the property is changed."
Determines the minimum size of the target container using this layout manager. This method is called when a container calls its getMinimumSize method. Most applications do not call this method directly.
To retrieve current cookie store.
Sets the designated parameter to a java.sql.NClob object. The driver converts this oa SQL NCLOB value when it sends it to the database.
Returns an IIOMetadataFormat object describing the standard, plug-in neutral javax.imageio_1.0 metadata document format described in the comment of the javax.imageio.metadata package.
Visits a LOCAL_VARIABLE variable element by calling defaultAction.
Standard override; no change in semantics.
The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type TIME.
The configuration used when Document.normalizeDocument() is invoked.
Returns a name for the locale's variant code that is appropriate for display to the user. If possible, the name will be localized for inLocale. If the locale doesn't specify a variant code, this function returns the empty string.Binds the specified value object into the session's application layer data with the given name. Any existing binding using the same name is replaced. If the new (or existing) value implements the SSLSessionBindingListener interface, the object represented by value is notified appropriately. For security reasons, the same named values may not be visible across different access control contexts.Returns an array containing the constants of this enum type, in the order they are declared. This method may be used to iterate over the constants as follows: for (SSLEngineResult.HandshakeStatus c : SSLEngineResult.HandshakeStatus.values()) System.out.println(c);
Constructs a new  Applet.  Note:  Many methods in java.applet. Applet may be invoked by the applet only after the applet is fully constructed; applet should avoid calling methods in java.applet. Applet in the constructor. Sets this applet's stub.  This is done automatically by the system.  If there is a security manager ,  its check Permission method is called with the  AWTPermission(""set Applet Stub"") permission if a stub has already been set. Determines if this applet is active.  An applet is marked active just before its start method is called.  It becomes inactive just before its stop method is called.
