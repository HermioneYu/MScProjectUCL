Removes all available elements from this queue and adds them to the given collection .  This operation may be more efficient than repeatedly polling this queue .  A failure encountered while attempting to add elements to collection c may result in elements being in neither ,  either or both collections when the associated exception is thrown .  Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in IllegalArgumentException .  Further ,  the behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress . 
Enumerates the names bound in the named context ,  along with the class names of objects bound to them .  See Context . list ( Name )  for details . 
This method gets called when a bound property is changed .

Size of the divider . 
Represents a control that changes the sample rate of audio playback .  The net effect of changing the sample rate depends on the relationship between the media's natural rate and the rate that is set via this control .  The natural rate is the sample rate that is specified in the data line's AudioFormat object .  For example ,  if the natural rate of the media is 11025 samples per second and the sample rate is set to 22050 samples per second ,  the media will play back at twice the normal speed .  Changing the sample rate with this control does not affect the data line's audio format .  Also note that whenever you change a sound's sample rate ,  a change in the sound's pitch results .  For example ,  doubling the sample rate has the effect of doubling the frequencies in the sound's spectrum ,  which raises the pitch by an octave . 
Creates a new AbstractQueuedSynchronizer instance with initial synchronization state of zero . 
Creates a new File instance by converting the given file: URI into an abstract pathname. The exact form of a file: URI is system - dependent ,  hence the transformation performed by this constructor is also system - dependent. For a given abstract pathname f it is guaranteed that new File( f.toURI( )  ) .equals( f.getAbsoluteFile( )  )  so long as the original abstract pathname ,  the URI ,  and the new abstract pathname are all created in (possibly different invocations of )  the same Java virtual machine. This relationship typically does not hold ,  however ,  when a file: URI that is created in a virtual machine on one operating system is converted into an abstract pathname in a virtual machine on a different operating system.
Sets this SOAPFault object with the give fault code .  Fault codes ,  which given information about the fault ,  are defined in the SOAP 1 . 1 specification .  This element is mandatory in SOAP 1 . 1 .  Because the fault code is required to be a QName it is preferable to use the setFaultCode ( Name )  form of this method . 
Returns a Result for setting the XML value designated by this SQLXML instance .  The systemID of the Result is implementation dependent .  The SQL XML object becomes not writeable when this method is called and may also become not readable depending on implementation .  Note that SAX is a callback architecture and the returned SAXResult has a content handler assigned that will receive the SAX events based on the contents of the XML .  Call the content handler with the contents of the XML document to assign the values .  SAXResult saxResult = sqlxml . setResult ( SAXResult . class); ContentHandler contentHandler = saxResult . getXMLReader ( ) . getContentHandler ( ); contentHandler . startDocument ( ); // set the XML elements and attributes into the result contentHandler . endDocument ( );
Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount subtracted .  This adjusts this temporal ,  subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount .  The amount is typically a Period but may be any other type implementing the TemporalAmount interface ,  such as Duration .  Some example code indicating how and why this method is used: date = date . minus ( period ) ; // subtract a Period instance date = date . minus ( duration ) ; // subtract a Duration instance date = date . minus ( workingDays ( 6 )  ) ; // example user - written workingDays method Note that calling plus followed by minus is not guaranteed to return the same date - time . 
An alias for ISO _ B10 . 
Obtains an instance of ZonedDateTime from the instant formed by combining the local date - time and offset. This creates a zoned date - time by combining the LocalDateTime and ZoneOffset. This combination uniquely specifies an instant without ambiguity. Converting an instant to a zoned date - time is simple as there is only one valid offset for each instant. If the valid offset is different to the offset specified ,  then the date - time and offset of the zoned date - time will differ from those specified. If the ZoneId to be used is a ZoneOffset ,  this method is equivalent to of ( LocalDateTime ,  ZoneId ) .

"Converts this BigDecimal to an int .  This conversion is analogous to the narrowing primitive conversion from double to short as defined in section 5 . 1 . 3 of The Javaâ„¢ Language Specification: any fractional part of this BigDecimal will be discarded ,  and if the resulting ""BigInteger"" is too big to fit in an int ,  only the low - order 32 bits are returned .  Note that this conversion can lose information about the overall magnitude and precision of this BigDecimal value as well as return a result with the opposite sign . "
Returns a list containing each LocalVariable that can be accessed from this frame's location. Visibility is based on the code index of the current instruction of this StackFrame. Each variable has a range of byte code indices in which it is accessible. If this stack frame's method matches this variable's method and if the code index of this StackFrame is within the variable's byte code range ,  the variable is visible. A variable's byte code range is at least as large as the scope of that variable ,  but can continue beyond the end of the scope under certain circumstances: the compiler/VM does not immediately reuse the variable's slot. the compiler/VM is implemented to report the extended range that would result from the item above. The advantage of an extended range is that variables from recently exited scopes may remain available for examination (this is especially useful for loop indices ) . If ,  as a result of the extensions above ,  the current frame location is contained within the range of multiple local variables of the same name ,  the variable with the highest - starting range is chosen for the returned list.
This convenience method calls the static method . 
Finishes writing uncompressed data to the output stream without closing the underlying stream .  Use this method when applying multiple filters in succession to the same output stream . 
Returns a copy of this ZonedDateTime with the second - of - minute altered .  This operates on the local time - line ,  changing the time of the local date - time .  This is then converted back to a ZonedDateTime ,  using the zone ID to obtain the offset .  When converting back to ZonedDateTime ,  if the local date - time is in an overlap ,  then the offset will be retained if possible ,  otherwise the earlier offset will be used .  If in a gap ,  the local date - time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap .  This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call . 
Frees any resources associated with this Reader .  This method does not close the underlying input source . 
Allows for further restricting of the characters that can be input .  Only characters specified in the mask ,  not in the invalidCharacters ,  and in validCharacters will be allowed to be input .  Passing in null (the default )  implies the valid characters are only bound by the mask and the valid characters . 
Overrides Graphics . fillPolygon . 
When an item's state changes ,  editing is ended . 
Checks whether two dimension objects have equal values . 
Sets field parameters to their values given by fieldValuePairs that are pairs of a field and its value. For example ,  setFeilds ( Calendar.YEAR ,  2013 ,  Calendar.MONTH ,  Calendar.DECEMBER ,  Calendar.DAY _ OF _ MONTH ,  23 ) ; is equivalent to the sequence of the following set calls: set ( Calendar.YEAR ,  2013 )  .set ( Calendar.MONTH ,  Calendar.DECEMBER )  .set ( Calendar.DAY _ OF _ MONTH ,  23 ) ;

"Indicates that this namespace (specified by namespace( )  )  has a schema already available exeternally, available at this location. This instructs the JAXB schema generators to simply refer to the pointed schema, as opposed to generating components into the schema. This schema is assumed to match what would be otherwise produced by the schema generator (same element names, same type names... )  This feature is intended to be used when a set of the Java classes is originally generated from an existing schema, hand - written to match externally defined schema, or the generated schema is modified manually. Value could be any absolute URI, like http://example.org/some.xsd. It is also possible to specify the empty string, to indicate that the schema is externally available but the location is unspecified (and thus it's the responsibility of the reader of the generate schema to locate it. )  Finally, the default value of this property ""##generate"" indicates that the schema generator is going to generate components for this namespace (as it did in JAXB 2.0. )  Multiple XmlSchema annotations on multiple packages are allowed to govern the same namespace( ) . In such case, all of them must have the same location( )  values. Note to implementor More precisely, the value must be either """", ""##generate"", or a valid lexical representation of xs:anyURI that begins with <scheme > :. A schema generator is expected to generate a corresponding <xs:import namespace=""..."" schemaLocation=""...""/ >  (or no schemaLocation attribute at all if the empty string is specified. )  However, the schema generator is allowed to use a different value in the schemaLocation attribute (including not generating such attribute ) , for example so that the user can specify a local copy of the resource through the command line interface."
Determines the date and time based on the arguments. The arguments are interpreted as a year ,  month ,  day of the month ,  hour of the day ,  minute within the hour ,  and second within the minute ,  exactly as for the Date constructor with six arguments ,  except that the arguments are interpreted relative to UTC rather than to the local time zone. The time indicated is returned represented as the distance ,  measured in milliseconds ,  of that time from the epoch (00:00:00 GMT on January 1 ,  1970 ) .
Log a message ,  with associated Throwable information .  If the logger is currently enabled for the given message level then the given arguments are stored in a LogRecord which is forwarded to all registered output handlers .  Note that the thrown argument is stored in the LogRecord thrown property ,  rather than the LogRecord parameters property .  Thus it is processed specially by output Formatters and is not treated as a formatting parameter to the LogRecord message property .

Subclasses may implement this method to store custom data in the stream along with descriptors for dynamic proxy classes .  This method is called exactly once for each unique proxy class descriptor in the stream .  The default implementation of this method in ObjectOutputStream does nothing .  The corresponding method in ObjectInputStream is resolveProxyClass .  For a given subclass of ObjectOutputStream that overrides this method ,  the resolveProxyClass method in the corresponding subclass of ObjectInputStream must read any data or objects written by annotateProxyClass . 
The proleptic-month based ,  counting months sequentially from year 0. This field is the sequential count of months where the first month in proleptic-year zero has the value zero. Later months have increasingly larger values. Earlier months have increasingly small values. There are no gaps or breaks in the sequence of months. Note that this uses the local time-line ,  ignoring offset and time-zone. In the default ISO calendar system ,  June 2012 would have the value (2012 * 12 + 6 - 1 ) . This field is primarily for internal use. Non-ISO calendar systems must implement this field as per the definition above. It is just a simple zero-based count of elapsed months from the start of proleptic-year 0. All calendar systems with a full proleptic-year definition will have a year zero. If the calendar system has a minimum year that excludes year zero ,  then one must be extrapolated in order for this method to be defined.

Reinitialize the insets parameter with this Border's current Insets . 
Sets the row height ,  this is forwarded to the treeState . 
Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given Object value .  This method is like setObject ( int parameterIndex ,  Object x ,  int targetSqlType ,  int scale )  except that it assumes a scale of zero .  The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this RowSet object's command when the method execute is called .  Methods such as execute and populate must be provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or more of the standard JSR-114 RowSet interfaces .  NOTE: JdbcRowSet does not require the populate method as it is undefined in this class .  Calls made to the method getParams after this version of setObject has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that have been set .  In that array ,  the element that represents the values set with this method will itself be an array .  The first element of that array is the given Object instance .  The second element is the value set for targetSqlType .  The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array returned by the method getParams ,  with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter ,  the second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter ,  and so on .  In other words ,  if the object being set is the value for the second placeholder parameter ,  the array containing it will be the second element in the array returned by getParams .  Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero ,  the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number parameterIndex is element number parameterIndex -1 . 
Bound property name for visibleRowCount . 
Creates an XPathFilterParameterSpec with the specified XPath expression . 
The class fingerprint that is set to indicate serialization compatibility with a previous version of the class .

Some prepared statements return multiple results; the execute method handles these complex statements as well as the simpler form of statements handled by the methods executeQuery and executeUpdate. The execute method returns a boolean to indicate the form of the first result. You must call either the method getResultSet or getUpdateCount to retrieve the result; you must call getMoreResults to move to any subsequent result ( s ) .
Set the method for the URL request ,  one of: GET POST HEAD OPTIONS PUT DELETE TRACE are legal ,  subject to protocol restrictions .  The default method is GET . 
The actual listener that is installed on the component instances .  This listener calls the other registered listeners when an event occurs .  By doing things this way ,  the actual number of listeners installed on a component instance is drastically reduced . 
Convenience method for setting a component's border property with a value from the defaults .  The border is only set if the border is null or an instance of UIResource . 
Constructs a NegativeArraySizeException with no detail message . 
Show Entity nodes .  This is meaningful only when creating an NodeIterator or TreeWalker with an Entity node as its root; in this case ,  it means that the Entity node will appear in the first position of the traversal .  Since entities are not part of the document tree ,  they do not appear when traversing over the document tree . 
One or more doors on the device are open .

Return true if the named field is defaulted and has no value in this stream . 
Constructs a new FileSystem to access the contents of a file as a file system .  This method is intended for specialized providers of pseudo file systems where the contents of one or more files is treated as a file system .  The env parameter is a map of provider specific properties to configure the file system .  If this provider does not support the creation of such file systems or if the provider does not recognize the file type of the given file then it throws UnsupportedOperationException .  The default implementation of this method throws UnsupportedOperationException . 
Register unmarshal event callback Unmarshaller . Listener with this Unmarshaller .  There is only one Listener per Unmarshaller .  Setting a Listener replaces the previous set Listener .  One can unregister current Listener by setting listener to null . 
Indicates the containing annotation type for the repeatable annotation type .

Determines whether the track is painted on the slider .  By default ,  this property is true . 
"Gets the singleton instance of the system Clipboard which interfaces with clipboard facilities provided by the native platform. This clipboard enables data transfer between Java programs and native applications which use native clipboard facilities. In addition to any and all formats specified in the flavormap.properties file ,  or other file specified by the AWT.DnD.flavorMapFileURL Toolkit property ,  text returned by the system Clipboard's getTransferData( )  method is available in the following flavors: DataFlavor.stringFlavor DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor (deprecated )  As with java.awt.datatransfer.StringSelection ,  if the requested flavor is DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor ,  or an equivalent flavor ,  a Reader is returned. Note: The behavior of the system Clipboard's getTransferData( )  method for DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor ,  and equivalent DataFlavors ,  is inconsistent with the definition of DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor . Because of this ,  support for DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor ,  and equivalent flavors ,  is deprecated. Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there is a security manager installed. If there is ,  the method should call the security manager's checkPermission method to check AWTPermission(""accessClipboard"" ) ."
Returns the class part . 
Creates a newly allocated byte array .  Its size is the current size of this output stream and the valid contents of the buffer have been copied into it . 
Creates a new RSAPrivateKeySpec . 
Sets this channel's position .  Setting the position to a value that is greater than the current size is legal but does not change the size of the entity .  A later attempt to read bytes at such a position will immediately return an end - of - file indication .  A later attempt to write bytes at such a position will cause the entity to grow to accommodate the new bytes; the values of any bytes between the previous end - of - file and the newly - written bytes are unspecified .  Setting the channel's position is not recommended when connected to an entity ,  typically a file ,  that is opened with the APPEND option .  When opened for append ,  the position is first advanced to the end before writing . 
Constructs a new Canvas given a GraphicsConfiguration object . 
Returns the focus owner ,  even if the calling thread is in a different context than the focus owner .  The focus owner is defined as the Component in an application that will typically receive all KeyEvents generated by the user .  KeyEvents which map to the focus owner's focus traversal keys will not be delivered if focus traversal keys are enabled for the focus owner .  In addition ,  KeyEventDispatchers may retarget or consume KeyEvents before they reach the focus owner .  This method will throw a SecurityException if this KeyboardFocusManager is not the current KeyboardFocusManager for the calling thread's context .

Returns an IIOMetadataFormat object describing the given metadata format ,  or null if no description is available. The supplied name must be one of those returned by getMetadataFormatNames (i.e. ,  either the native format name ,  the standard format name ,  or one of those returned by getExtraMetadataFormatNames ) . The default implementation checks the name against the global standard metadata format name ,  and returns that format if it is supported. Otherwise ,  it checks against the native format names followed by any additional format names. If a match is found ,  it retrieves the name of the IIOMetadataFormat class from nativeMetadataFormatClassName or extraMetadataFormatClassNames as appropriate ,  and constructs an instance of that class using its getInstance method.

This request can only be made on the context initiator's side and it has to be done prior to the first call to initSecContext .  Not all mechanisms support mutual authentication and some mechanisms might require mutual authentication even if the application doesn't .  Therefore ,  the application should check to see if the request was honored with the getMutualAuthState method . 
Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire .

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer. This method initiates an asynchronous write operation to write a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer. The handler parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the write operation completes (or fails ) . The result passed to the completion handler is the number of bytes written. If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation completes then it completes with the exception InterruptedByTimeoutException. Where a timeout occurs ,  and the implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been written ,  or will not be written to the channel from the given buffer ,  then further attempts to write to the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be thrown. Otherwise this method works in the same manner as the AsynchronousByteChannel.write(ByteBuffer , Object , CompletionHandler )  method.

Relative bulk get method .  This method transfers floats from this buffer into the given destination array .  If there are fewer floats remaining in the buffer than are required to satisfy the request, that is, if length > remaining( ) , then no floats are transferred and a BufferUnderflowException is thrown .  Otherwise, this method copies length floats from this buffer into the given array, starting at the current position of this buffer and at the given offset in the array .  The position of this buffer is then incremented by length .  In other words, an invocation of this method of the form src . get(dst, off, len )  has exactly the same effect as the loop for (int i = off; i < off + len; i++ )  dst [ i ]  = src . get( ) : except that it first checks that there are sufficient floats in this buffer and it is potentially much more efficient . 
Returns the inner highlight color of the bevel border .  Will return null if no highlight color was specified at instantiation .

Installs the AbstractFormatter onto a particular JFormattedTextField .  This will invoke valueToString to convert the current value from the JFormattedTextField to a String .  This will then install the Actions from getActions ,  the DocumentFilter returned from getDocumentFilter and the NavigationFilter returned from getNavigationFilter onto the JFormattedTextField .  Subclasses will typically only need to override this if they wish to install additional listeners on the JFormattedTextField .  If there is a ParseException in converting the current value to a String ,  this will set the text to an empty String ,  and mark the JFormattedTextField as being in an invalid state .  While this is a public method ,  this is typically only useful for subclassers of JFormattedTextField .  JFormattedTextField will invoke this method at the appropriate times when the value changes ,  or its internal state changes .  You will only need to invoke this yourself if you are subclassing JFormattedTextField and installing/uninstalling AbstractFormatter at a different time than JFormattedTextField does .

Converts the given any into a byte array based on the encoding format effective for this Codec . 
"Returns the canonical pathname string of this abstract pathname. A canonical pathname is both absolute and unique. The precise definition of canonical form is system - dependent. This method first converts this pathname to absolute form if necessary, as if by invoking the getAbsolutePath( )  method, and then maps it to its unique form in a system - dependent way. This typically involves removing redundant names such as ""."" and "".."" from the pathname, resolving symbolic links (on UNIX platforms ) , and converting drive letters to a standard case (on Microsoft Windows platforms ) . Every pathname that denotes an existing file or directory has a unique canonical form. Every pathname that denotes a nonexistent file or directory also has a unique canonical form. The canonical form of the pathname of a nonexistent file or directory may be different from the canonical form of the same pathname after the file or directory is created. Similarly, the canonical form of the pathname of an existing file or directory may be different from the canonical form of the same pathname after the file or directory is deleted."

"The DOMConfiguration object used by the LSSerializer when serializing a DOM node. In addition to the parameters recognized by the DOMConfiguration interface defined in [DOM Level 3 Core ]  , the DOMConfiguration objects for LSSerializer adds, or modifies, the following parameters: ""canonical - form"" true [optional ]  Writes the document according to the rules specified in [Canonical XML ] . In addition to the behavior described in "" canonical - form"" [DOM Level 3 Core ]  , setting this parameter to true will set the parameters ""format - pretty - print"", ""discard - default - content"", and ""xml - declaration "", to false. Setting one of those parameters to true will set this parameter to false. Serializing an XML 1.1 document when ""canonical - form"" is true will generate a fatal error. false [required ]  (default )  Do not canonicalize the output. ""discard - default - content"" true [required ]  (default )  Use the Attr.specified attribute to decide what attributes should be discarded. Note that some implementations might use whatever information available to the implementation (i.e. XML schema, DTD, the Attr.specified attribute, and so on )  to determine what attributes and content to discard if this parameter is set to true. false [required ] Keep all attributes and all content. ""format - pretty - print"" true [optional ]  Formatting the output by adding whitespace to produce a pretty - printed, indented, human - readable form. The exact form of the transformations is not specified by this specification. Pretty - printing changes the content of the document and may affect the validity of the document, validating implementations should preserve validity. false [required ]  (default )  Don't pretty - print the result. ""ignore - unknown - character - denormalizations"" true [required ]  (default )  If, while verifying full normalization when [XML 1.1 ]  is supported, a character is encountered for which the normalization properties cannot be determined, then raise a ""unknown - character - denormalization"" warning (instead of raising an error, if this parameter is not set )  and ignore any possible denormalizations caused by these characters. false [optional ]  Report a fatal error if a character is encountered for which the processor cannot determine the normalization properties. ""normalize - characters"" This parameter is equivalent to the one defined by DOMConfiguration in [DOM Level 3 Core ]  . Unlike in the Core, the default value for this parameter is true. While DOM implementations are not required to support fully normalizing the characters in the document according to appendix E of [XML 1.1 ] , this parameter must be activated by default if supported. ""xml - declaration"" true [required ]  (default )  If a Document, Element, or Entity node is serialized, the XML declaration, or text declaration, should be included. The version (Document.xmlVersion if the document is a Level 3 document and the version is non - null, otherwise use the value ""1.0"" ) , and the output encoding (see LSSerializer.write for details on how to find the output encoding )  are specified in the serialized XML declaration. false [required ]  Do not serialize the XML and text declarations. Report a ""xml - declaration - needed"" warning if this will cause problems (i.e. the serialized data is of an XML version other than [XML 1.0 ] , or an encoding would be needed to be able to re - parse the serialized data ) ."

See the border - top - color property definition in CSS2 . 
Determine if the object is visible .  Note: this means that the object intends to be visible; however ,  it may not be showing on the screen because one of the objects that this object is contained by is currently not visible .  To determine if an object is showing on the screen ,  use isShowing ( ) .  Objects that are visible will also have the AccessibleState . VISIBLE state set in their AccessibleStateSet . 
Appends the geometry of the specified Shape object to the path ,  possibly connecting the new geometry to the existing path segments with a line segment .  If the connect parameter is true and the path is not empty then any initial moveTo in the geometry of the appended Shape is turned into a lineTo segment .  If the destination coordinates of such a connecting lineTo segment match the ending coordinates of a currently open subpath then the segment is omitted as superfluous .  The winding rule of the specified Shape is ignored and the appended geometry is governed by the winding rule specified for this path . 
Creates an ImageIcon from the specified URL .  The image will be preloaded by using MediaTracker to monitor the loaded state of the image . 
Creates a view that represents a portion of the element .  This is potentially useful during formatting operations for taking measurements of fragments of the view .  If the view doesn't support fragmenting (the default ) , it should return itself .  This view does support fragmenting .  It is implemented to return a nested class that shares state in this view representing only a portion of the view . 
Constructs a string tokenizer for the specified string .  All characters in the delim argument are the delimiters for separating tokens .  If the returnDelims flag is true ,  then the delimiter characters are also returned as tokens .  Each delimiter is returned as a string of length one .  If the flag is false ,  the delimiter characters are skipped and only serve as separators between tokens .  Note that if delim is null ,  this constructor does not throw an exception .  However ,  trying to invoke other methods on the resulting StringTokenizer may result in a NullPointerException . 
Creates a BooleanValue for the given value .  This value can be used for setting and comparing against a value retrieved from a variable or field in this virtual machine . 
Stops the current editing session .  This has no effect if the tree isn't being edited .  Returns true if the editor allows the editing session to stop . 
"A DOMString indicating which related data is expected in relatedData .  Users should refer to the specification of the error in order to find its DOMString type and relatedData definitions if any .  Note: As an example ,  Document . normalizeDocument ( ) does generate warnings when the ""split - cdata - sections"" parameter is in use .  Therefore ,  the method generates a SEVERITY _ WARNING with type ""cdata - sections - splitted"" and the first CDATASection node in document order resulting from the split is returned by the relatedData attribute . "
Sets the designated parameter to the given Java short value .  The driver converts this to an SQL SMALLINT value when it sends it to the database . 
Skips the specified number of characters in the stream .  Returns the number of characters that were skipped .  The ns parameter may be negative ,  even though the skip method of the Reader superclass throws an exception in this case .  Negative values of ns cause the stream to skip backwards .  Negative return values indicate a skip backwards .  It is not possible to skip backwards past the beginning of the string .  If the entire string has been read or skipped ,  then this method has no effect and always returns 0 . 
Invokes the paint method on each UI handled by this object . 
Sets the desired image type for the destination image ,  using an ImageTypeSpecifier. When reading ,  if the layout of the destination has been set using this method ,  each call to an ImageReader read method will return a new BufferedImage using the format specified by the supplied type specifier. As a side effect ,  any destination BufferedImage set by ImageReadParam.setDestination ( BufferedImage )  will no longer be set as the destination. In other words ,  this method may be thought of as calling setDestination (  ( BufferedImage ) null ) . When writing ,  the destination type maybe used to determine the color type of the image. The SampleModel information will be ignored ,  and may be null. For example ,  a 4 - banded image could represent either CMYK or RGBA data. If a destination type is set ,  its ColorModel will override any ColorModel on the image itself. This is crucial when setSourceBands is used since the image's ColorModel will refer to the entire image rather than to the subset of bands being written.
Fetches the portion of the model for which this view is responsible . 
Tests this abstract pathname for equality with the given object .  Returns true if and only if the argument is not null and is an abstract pathname that denotes the same file or directory as this abstract pathname .  Whether or not two abstract pathnames are equal depends upon the underlying system .  On UNIX systems ,  alphabetic case is significant in comparing pathnames; on Microsoft Windows systems it is not . 
Returns an enumeration over the names of the attributes that are defined locally in the set .  Names of attributes defined in the resolving parent ,  if any ,  are not included .  The values of the Enumeration may be anything and are not constrained to a particular Object type .  This method never returns null .  For a set with no attributes ,  it returns an empty Enumeration .

If the returned Source is an instance of DOMSource ,  then modifications to the encapsulated DOM tree change the message payload in - place ,  there is no need to susequently call setPayload .  Other types of Source provide only read access to the message payload . 
Creates an appropriate call object for a new remote method invocation on this object .  Passing operation array and index ,  allows the stubs generator to assign the operation indexes and interpret them .  The remote reference may need the operation to encode in the call . 
Sets the minCRLNumber criterion .  The X509CRL must have a CRL number extension whose value is greater than or equal to the specified value .  If null ,  no minCRLNumber check will be done . 
Resets the barrier to its initial state .  If any parties are currently waiting at the barrier ,  they will return with a BrokenBarrierException .  Note that resets after a breakage has occurred for other reasons can be complicated to carry out; threads need to re - synchronize in some other way ,  and choose one to perform the reset .  It may be preferable to instead create a new barrier for subsequent use . 
Returns an array of Class objects that represent the formal parameter types ,  in declaration order ,  of the executable represented by this object .  Returns an array of length 0 if the underlying executable takes no parameters . 
Overridable method to perform an action upon impending phase advance ,  and to control termination. This method is invoked upon arrival of the party advancing this phaser (when all other waiting parties are dormant ) . If this method returns true ,  this phaser will be set to a final termination state upon advance ,  and subsequent calls to isTerminated( )  will return true. Any (unchecked )  Exception or Error thrown by an invocation of this method is propagated to the party attempting to advance this phaser ,  in which case no advance occurs. The arguments to this method provide the state of the phaser prevailing for the current transition. The effects of invoking arrival ,  registration ,  and waiting methods on this phaser from within onAdvance are unspecified and should not be relied on. If this phaser is a member of a tiered set of phasers ,  then onAdvance is invoked only for its root phaser on each advance. To support the most common use cases ,  the default implementation of this method returns true when the number of registered parties has become zero as the result of a party invoking arriveAndDeregister. You can disable this behavior ,  thus enabling continuation upon future registrations ,  by overriding this method to always return false: Phaser phaser = new Phaser( )  { protected boolean onAdvance(int phase ,  int parties )  { return false; } }
Register all Mission Control related MBeans/MXBeans with the MBean server .  If one or more MBeans can't be registered ,  for whatever reason ,  the method will do a best effort and register as many MBeans as possible . 
Concatenates this transform with a transform that rotates coordinates around an anchor point. This operation is equivalent to translating the coordinates so that the anchor point is at the origin (S1 ) , then rotating them about the new origin (S2 ) , and finally translating so that the intermediate origin is restored to the coordinates of the original anchor point (S3 ) . This operation is equivalent to the following sequence of calls: translate(anchorx, anchory ) ; // S3: final translation rotate(theta ) ; // S2: rotate around anchor translate(-anchorx, -anchory ) ; // S1: translate anchor to origin Rotating by a positive angle theta rotates points on the positive X axis toward the positive Y axis. Note also the discussion of Handling 90-Degree Rotations above.

Indicates that the data type can be only be used in WHERE search clauses that do not use LIKE predicates .  A possible value for column SEARCHABLE in the ResultSet object returned by the method getTypeInfo . 
If updateLayoutStateNeeded is non zero ,  call updateLayoutState ( ) and reset updateLayoutStateNeeded .  This method should be called by methods before doing any computation based on the geometry of the list .  For example it's the first call in paint ( ) and getPreferredSize ( ) . 
Creates a PropertyChangeListener which will be added to the combo box .  If this method returns null then it will not be added to the combo box . 
Priority for accelerating this image .  Subclasses are free to set different default priorities and applications are free to set the priority for specific images via the setAccelerationPriority ( float )  method . 
Sets the remaining name field of this result to name .  A copy of name is made so that modifying the copy within this ResolveResult does not affect name and vice versa . 
Asks the user to choose a single file .  The contents of a potential selected file is returned as a FileContents object .  The returned FileContents object contains the contents along with the name of the file .  The full path is not returned .

Tests if a specified Point2D is inside the boundary of the Shape ,  as described by the definition of insideness . 
Subdivides the cubic curve specified by the coordinates stored in the src array at indices srcoff through (srcoff + 7 )  and stores the resulting two subdivided curves into the two result arrays at the corresponding indices .  Either or both of the left and right arrays may be null or a reference to the same array as the src array .  Note that the last point in the first subdivided curve is the same as the first point in the second subdivided curve .  Thus, it is possible to pass the same array for left and right and to use offsets, such as rightoff equals (leftoff + 6 ) , in order to avoid allocating extra storage for this common point . 
Sets the active Window .  Only a Frame or a Dialog can be the active Window .  The native windowing system may denote the active Window or its children with special decorations ,  such as a highlighted title bar .  The active Window is always either the focused Window ,  or the first Frame or Dialog that is an owner of the focused Window .  This method does not actually change the active Window as far as the native windowing system is concerned .  It merely stores the value to be subsequently returned by getActiveWindow ( ) .  Use Component . requestFocus ( ) or Component . requestFocusInWindow ( )to change the active Window ,  subject to platform limitations . 
Receive notification of character data inside an element. By default ,  do nothing. Application writers may override this method to take specific actions for each chunk of character data (such as adding the data to a node or buffer ,  or printing it to a file ) .
Obtains the current program number for this channel . 
Gets a resource bundle using the specified base name ,  the default locale ,  and the caller's class loader .  Calling this method is equivalent to calling getBundle ( baseName ,  Locale . getDefault ( ) ,  this . getClass ( ) . getClassLoader ( )) ,  except that getClassLoader ( ) is run with the security privileges of ResourceBundle .  See getBundle for a complete description of the search and instantiation strategy .

If an attempt is made to add an attribute that is already in use elsewhere . 
Overrides Graphics . drawString . 
Attempts to acquire a lock on the given region of this channel's file .  This method does not block .  An invocation always returns immediately ,  either having acquired a lock on the requested region or having failed to do so .  If it fails to acquire a lock because an overlapping lock is held by another program then it returns null .  If it fails to acquire a lock for any other reason then an appropriate exception is thrown .  The region specified by the position and size parameters need not be contained within ,  or even overlap ,  the actual underlying file .  Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock .  If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is required then a region starting at zero ,  and no smaller than the expected maximum size of the file ,  should be locked .  The zero - argument tryLock ( ) method simply locks a region of size Long . MAX _ VALUE .  Some operating systems do not support shared locks ,  in which case a request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for an exclusive lock .  Whether the newly - acquired lock is shared or exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object's isShared method .  File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine .  They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple threads within the same virtual machine .

Used for instances of ErroneousTree . 
Obtains the current instant from the specified clock .  This will query the specified clock to obtain the current time .  Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing .  The alternate clock may be introduced using dependency injection . 
Converts this date to the Epoch Day. The Epoch Day count is a simple incrementing count of days where day 0 is 1970 - 01 - 01 (ISO ) . This definition is the same for all chronologies ,  enabling conversion. This default implementation queries the EPOCH _ DAY field.
Create a processing instruction
Get the value of a constant field . 
Removes the menu item at the specified index from this menu . 
Obtains the key as a localized string .  If a localized string cannot be found for the key ,  the locale independent key stored in the role will be returned . 
Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered .  This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed .  For example ,  on a LocalDate ,  this could be used to set the year ,  month or day - of - month .  The returned object will have the same observable type as this object .  In some cases ,  changing a field is not fully defined .  For example ,  if the target object is a date representing the 31st January ,  then changing the month to February would be unclear .  In cases like this ,  the field is responsible for resolving the result .  Typically it will choose the previous valid date ,  which would be the last valid day of February in this example . 
Sets the paintFocus property ,  which must be true for the focus state to be painted .  The default value for the paintFocus property is true .  Some look and feels might not paint focus state; they will ignore this property . 
Used for instances of EnhancedForLoopTree . 
Overrides equals
Performs an implementation - dependent unit of work if called by the main thread .  Otherwise it does nothing .  The methods work _ pending and perform _ work can be used in conjunction to implement a simple polling loop that multiplexes the main thread among the ORB and other activities . 
Sets the value of the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate certificates that may exist in a certification path. A certificate is self-issued if the DNs that appear in the subject and issuer fields are identical and are not empty. Note that the last certificate in a certification path is not an intermediate certificate ,  and is not included in this limit. Usually the last certificate is an end entity certificate ,  but it can be a CA certificate. A PKIX CertPathBuilder instance must not build paths longer than the length specified. A value of 0 implies that the path can only contain a single certificate. A value of -1 implies that the path length is unconstrained (i.e. there is no maximum ) . The default maximum path length ,  if not specified ,  is 5. Setting a value less than -1 will cause an exception to be thrown. If any of the CA certificates contain the BasicConstraintsExtension ,  the value of the pathLenConstraint field of the extension overrides the maximum path length parameter whenever the result is a certification path of smaller length.
Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffers .  An invocation of this method of the form c . write ( srcs )  behaves in exactly the same manner as the invocation c . write ( srcs ,  0 ,  srcs . length ) ;
Returns an array of all the ActionListeners added to this AbstractButton with addActionListener ( ) . 
Returns the value the user has selected .  UNINITIALIZED _ VALUE implies the user has not yet made a choice ,  null means the user closed the window with out choosing anything .  Otherwise the returned value will be one of the options defined in this object . 
AlphaComposite object that implements the opaque DST _ IN rule with an alpha of 1 . 0f . 
Returns a copy of this instant with the specified amount subtracted. This returns an Instant ,  based on this one ,  with the specified amount subtracted. The amount is typically Duration but may be any other type implementing the TemporalAmount interface. The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling TemporalAmount.subtractFrom ( Temporal ) . The amount implementation is free to implement the subtraction in any way it wishes ,  however it typically calls back to minus ( long ,  TemporalUnit ) . Consult the documentation of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully subtracted. This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
"Creates a new SOAPFactory object that is an instance of the default implementation (SOAP 1 . 1 ) , This method uses the following ordered lookup procedure to determine the SOAPFactory implementation class to load: Use the javax . xml . soap .

Gets the PropertyChangeListener (if any )  of the specified child
Retrieves names of all known relation types . 
Supplies a BufferedImage to be used as the destination for decoded pixel data .  The currently set image will be written to by the read ,  readAll ,  and readRaster methods ,  and a reference to it will be returned by those methods .  Pixel data from the aforementioned methods will be written starting at the offset specified by getDestinationOffset .  If destination is null ,  a newly - created BufferedImage will be returned by those methods .  At the time of reading ,  the image is checked to verify that its ColorModel and SampleModel correspond to one of the ImageTypeSpecifiers returned from the ImageReader's getImageTypes method .  If it does not ,  the reader will throw an IIOException . 
Constructs a parameter set for OAEP padding as defined in the PKCS #1 standard using the specified message digest algorithm mdName ,  mask generation function algorithm mgfName ,  parameters for the mask generation function mgfSpec ,  and source of the encoding input P pSrc . 
Deny knowledge about the class and customizer of the bean .  You can override this if you wish to provide explicit info . 
Fetches the editor kit to use for the given type of content .  This is called when a type is requested that doesn't match the currently installed type .  If the component doesn't have an EditorKit registered for the given type ,  it will try to create an EditorKit from the default EditorKit registry .  If that fails ,  a PlainEditorKit is used on the assumption that all text documents can be represented as plain text .  This method can be reimplemented to use some other kind of type registry .  This can be reimplemented to use the Java Activation Framework ,  for example . 
Returns the difference of the arguments ,  throwing an exception if the result overflows an int . 
Finds the greatest double less than d .  If NaN ,  returns same value . 
This method gets called when a bound property is changed . 
Constant for the F16 function key . 
Fetches the command list for the editor .  This is the list of commands supported by the plugged - in UI augmented by the collection of commands that the editor itself supports .  These are useful for binding to events ,  such as in a keymap . 
Returns the floating - point number adjacent to the first argument in the direction of the second argument. If both arguments compare as equal the second argument is returned. Special cases: If either argument is a NaN ,  then NaN is returned. If both arguments are signed zeros ,  direction is returned unchanged (as implied by the requirement of returning the second argument if the arguments compare as equal ) . If start is Â±Double.MIN _ VALUE and direction has a value such that the result should have a smaller magnitude ,  then a zero with the same sign as start is returned. If start is infinite and direction has a value such that the result should have a smaller magnitude ,  Double.MAX _ VALUE with the same sign as start is returned. If start is equal to Â± Double.MAX _ VALUE and direction has a value such that the result should have a larger magnitude ,  an infinity with same sign as start is returned.

Constructs a new arc ,  initialized to the specified location ,  size ,  angular extents ,  and closure type . 
The proleptic year ,  such as 2012 .  This represents the concept of the year ,  counting sequentially and using negative numbers .  The proleptic year is not interpreted in terms of the era .  See YEAR _ OF _ ERA for an example showing the mapping from proleptic year to year-of-era .  The standard mental model for a date is based on three concepts - year ,  month and day .  These map onto the YEAR ,  MONTH _ OF _ YEAR and DAY _ OF _ MONTH fields .  Note that there is no reference to eras .  The full model for a date requires four concepts - era ,  year ,  month and day .  These map onto the ERA ,  YEAR _ OF _ ERA ,  MONTH _ OF _ YEAR and DAY _ OF _ MONTH fields .  Whether this field or YEAR _ OF _ ERA is used depends on which mental model is being used .  See ChronoLocalDate for more discussion on this topic .  Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field as follows .  If the calendar system has only two eras ,  before and after a fixed date ,  then the proleptic-year value must be the same as the year-of-era value for the later era ,  and increasingly negative for the earlier era .  If the calendar system has more than two eras ,  then the proleptic-year value may be defined with any appropriate value ,  although defining it to be the same as ISO may be the best option . 
Gets the DragSource object associated with the underlying platform . 
Constructs a new exception with the specified cause and a detail message of (cause==null ? null : cause.toString( )  )  (which typically contains the class and detail message of cause ) . This constructor is useful for exceptions that are little more than wrappers for other throwables (for example ,  PrivilegedActionException ) .
Returns an array containing the constants of this enum type ,  in the order they are declared .  This method may be used to iterate over the constants as follows: for (StandardProtocolFamily c : StandardProtocolFamily . values( )  )  System . out . println(c ) ;

Gets an element by name .  A new element is created if the element doesn't exist . 
Handles the method MBeanServerConnection.createMBean ( String ,  ObjectName ,  ObjectName ) .
Allows the MBean to perform any operations needed after having been unregistered in the MBean server .  If the implementation of this method throws a RuntimeException or an Error ,  the MBean Server will rethrow those inside a RuntimeMBeanException or RuntimeErrorException ,  respectively .  However ,  throwing an exception in postDeregister will not change the state of the MBean: the MBean was already successfully deregistered and will remain so .  This might be confusing for the code calling unregisterMBean ( ) ,  as it might assume that MBean deregistration has failed .  Therefore it is recommended that implementations of postDeregister do not throw Runtime Exceptions or Errors if it can be avoided . 
Request frame borders .  See the frameborder attribute definition in HTML 4 . 0 . 
Return true if the underlying platform supports and or permits this look and feel .  This method returns false if the look and feel depends on special resources or legal agreements that aren't defined for the current platform . 
Returns the LineMetrics object for the specified String in the specified Graphics context . 
Checks that the specified value is valid and fits in an int .  This validates that the value is within the outer range of valid values returned by range ( ) .  It also checks that all valid values are within the bounds of an int .  This method checks against the range of the field in the ISO - 8601 calendar system .  This range may be incorrect for other calendar systems .  Use Chronology . range ( ChronoField) to access the correct range for a different calendar system . 
The number of pairs (name and namespaceURI )  in the list .  The range of valid child node indices is 0 to length - 1 inclusive . 
Construct a ConfirmationCallback with a prompt ,  message type ,  a list of options and a default option. Underlying security services use this constructor if they require a confirmation different from the available preset confirmations provided (for example ,  CONTINUE/ABORT or STOP/GO ) . The confirmation options are listed in the options array ,  and are displayed by the CallbackHandler implementation in a manner consistent with the way preset options are displayed.
Return the primary component of a collation element . 
Removes all the components from this container .  This method also notifies the layout manager to remove the components from this container's layout via the removeLayoutComponent method .  This method changes layout - related information ,  and therefore ,  invalidates the component hierarchy .  If the container has already been displayed ,  the hierarchy must be validated thereafter in order to reflect the changes . 
Returns an array of MonitorInfo objects ,  each of which represents an object monitor currently locked by the thread associated with this ThreadInfo .  If no locked monitor was requested for this thread info or no monitor is locked by the thread ,  this method will return a zero - length array . 
Constructs an UnexpectedException with the specified detail message . 
Returns the number of entries in the ZIP file . 
Constructor taking field names and field values .  Neither array can be null . 
Executes command with zero required delay .  This has effect equivalent to schedule ( command ,  0 ,  anyUnit) .  Note that inspections of the queue and of the list returned by shutdownNow will access the zero - delayed ScheduledFuture ,  not the command itself .  A consequence of the use of ScheduledFuture objects is that afterExecute is always called with a null second Throwable argument ,  even if the command terminated abruptly .  Instead ,  the Throwable thrown by such a task can be obtained via Future . get ( ) . 
Retrieves the driver's major version number .  Initially this should be 1 . 
Returns the first day of a week in the given locale .  This information is required by Calendar to support operations on the week - related calendar fields .

See ControlFactory . getControlInstance ( ) for details .  This property may be specified in the environment ,  an applet parameter ,  a system property ,  or one or more resource files .  The value of this constant is ""java . naming . factory . control"" . "
Whether to display a border around the progress bar .  The default is true . 
Produces a method handle which adapts the type of the given method handle to a new type by pairwise argument and return type conversion .  The original type and new type must have the same number of arguments .  The resulting method handle is guaranteed to report a type which is equal to the desired new type .  If the original type and new type are equal, returns target .  The same conversions are allowed as for MethodHandle . asType, and some additional conversions are also applied if those conversions fail .  Given types T0, T1, one of the following conversions is applied if possible, before or instead of any conversions done by asType: If T0 and T1 are references, and T1 is an interface type, then the value of type T0 is passed as a T1 without a cast .  (This treatment of interfaces follows the usage of the bytecode verifier .  )  If T0 is boolean and T1 is another primitive, the boolean is converted to a byte value, 1 for true, 0 for false .  (This treatment follows the usage of the bytecode verifier .  )  If T1 is boolean and T0 is another primitive, T0 is converted to byte via Java casting conversion (JLS 5 . 5 ) , and the low order bit of the result is tested, as if by (x & 1 )  != 0 .  If T0 and T1 are primitives other than boolean, then a Java casting conversion (JLS 5 . 5 )  is applied .  (Specifically, T0 will convert to T1 by widening and/or narrowing .  )  If T0 is a reference and T1 a primitive, an unboxing conversion will be applied at runtime, possibly followed by a Java casting conversion (JLS 5 . 5 )  on the primitive value, possibly followed by a conversion from byte to boolean by testing the low - order bit .  If T0 is a reference and T1 a primitive, and if the reference is null at runtime, a zero value is introduced . 
Returns the leading surrogate (a high surrogate code unit )  of the surrogate pair representing the specified supplementary character (Unicode code point )  in the UTF - 16 encoding .  If the specified character is not a supplementary character, an unspecified char is returned .  If isSupplementaryCodePoint(x )  is true, then isHighSurrogate(highSurrogate(x )  )  and toCodePoint(highSurrogate(x ) , lowSurrogate(x )  )  == x are also always true . 
Adds the specified ChangeListener to the progress bar . 
Constructor which binds the VetoableChangeListener to a specific property . 
Sets the size of the divider to newSize .  That is the width if the splitpane is HORIZONTAL _ SPLIT ,  or the height of VERTICAL _ SPLIT . 
Returns the text to display if the image can't be loaded .  This is obtained from the Elements attribute set with the attribute name HTML . Attribute . ALT . 
Invokes the getAccessibleChildrenCount method on each UI handled by this object . 
Sets the designated parameter to the given java . sql . Date value ,  using the given Calendar object .  The driver uses the Calendar object to construct an SQL DATE value ,  which the driver then sends to the database .  With a a Calendar object ,  the driver can calculate the date taking into account a custom timezone .  If no Calendar object is specified ,  the driver uses the default timezone ,  which is that of the virtual machine running the application . 
Converts a long value into a string . 
Returns the bounds of this TextLayout .  The bounds are in standard coordinates .  Due to rasterization effects ,  this bounds might not enclose all of the pixels rendered by the TextLayout .  It might not coincide exactly with the ascent ,  descent ,  origin or advance of the TextLayout . 
Extracts the long value from this DynAny .  The IDL long long data type is mapped to the Java long data type . 
Returns a high precision bounding Rectangle2D that completely encloses this Area .  The Area class will attempt to return the tightest bounding box possible for the Shape .  The bounding box will not be padded to include the control points of curves in the outline of the Shape ,  but should tightly fit the actual geometry of the outline itself . 
Retrieves the designated parameter's SQL type . 
Retrieves all MimeHeader objects whose name does not match a name in the given array . 
Gives the UI delegate an opportunity to define the precise shape of this component for the sake of mouse processing . 
Returns true if this map contains no key - value mappings . 
Creates a new tool bar with the specified orientation .  The orientation must be either HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL . 
Inserts all of the elements in the specified collection into this list at the specified position (optional operation ) . Shifts the element currently at that position (if any )  and any subsequent elements to the right (increases their indices ) . The new elements will appear in this list in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's iterator. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress. (Note that this will occur if the specified collection is this list ,  and it's nonempty. )  This implementation gets an iterator over the specified collection and iterates over it ,  inserting the elements obtained from the iterator into this list at the appropriate position ,  one at a time ,  using add(int ,  E ) . Many implementations will override this method for efficiency. Note that this implementation throws an UnsupportedOperationException unless add(int ,  E )  is overridden.
Stub method for ActivationGroup . newInstance .  Invokes the invoke method on this instance's RemoteObject . ref field, with this as the first argument, a two-element Object [ ] as the second argument (with id as the first element and desc as the second element ) , and -5274445189091581345L as the third argument, and returns the result .  If that invocation throws a RuntimeException, RemoteException, or an ActivationException, then that exception is thrown to the caller .  If that invocation throws any other java . lang . Exception, then a java . rmi . UnexpectedException is thrown to the caller with the original exception as the cause . 
Returns the ClassLoader of this domain .

Determines the preferred size of the container argument using this grid layout .  The preferred width of a grid layout is the largest preferred width of all of the components in the container times the number of columns ,  plus the horizontal padding times the number of columns minus one ,  plus the left and right insets of the target container .  The preferred height of a grid layout is the largest preferred height of all of the components in the container times the number of rows ,  plus the vertical padding times the number of rows minus one ,  plus the top and bottom insets of the target container . 
Executes the given SQL statement ,  which may return multiple results ,  and signals the driver that the auto - generated keys indicated in the given array should be made available for retrieval. This array contains the names of the columns in the target table that contain the auto - generated keys that should be made available. The driver will ignore the array if the SQL statement is not an INSERT statement ,  or an SQL statement able to return auto - generated keys (the list of such statements is vendor - specific ) . In some (uncommon )  situations ,  a single SQL statement may return multiple result sets and/or update counts. Normally you can ignore this unless you are (1 )  executing a stored procedure that you know may return multiple results or (2 )  you are dynamically executing an unknown SQL string. The execute method executes an SQL statement and indicates the form of the first result. You must then use the methods getResultSet or getUpdateCount to retrieve the result ,  and getMoreResults to move to any subsequent result(s ) . Note:This method cannot be called on a PreparedStatement or CallableStatement.
Return a reference to the DOM Node if available
Retrieves whether this database supports transactions .  If not ,  invoking the method commit is a noop ,  and the isolation level is TRANSACTION _ NONE .

Returns the TypeCode object at the given index .  The first item is at index 0 . 
Sets the designated parameter to the given input stream ,  which will have the specified number of bytes .  When a very large binary value is input to a LONGVARBINARY parameter ,  it may be more practical to send it via a java . io . InputStream object .  The data will be read from the stream as needed until end - of - file is reached .  Note: This stream object can either be a standard Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the standard interface . 
Returns the DynAny for the component at the current position .  It does not advance the current position ,  so repeated calls to current _ component without an intervening call to rewind ,  next ,  or seek return the same component .  The returned DynAny object reference can be used to get/set the value of the current component .  If the current component represents a complex type ,  the returned reference can be narrowed based on the TypeCode to get the interface corresponding to the to the complex type .  Calling current _ component on a DynAny that cannot have components ,  such as a DynEnum or an empty exception ,  raises TypeMismatch .  Calling current _ component on a DynAny whose current position is -1 returns a nil reference .  The iteration operations ,  together with current _ component ,  can be used to dynamically compose an any value .  After creating a dynamic any ,  such as a DynStruct ,  current _ component and next can be used to initialize all the components of the value .  Once the dynamic value is completely initialized ,  to _ any creates the corresponding any value . 
Indicates that a NULL value is NOT allowed for this data type .  A possible value for column NULLABLE in the ResultSet object returned by the method getTypeInfo . 
Returns an iteration object that defines the boundary of the shape of this QuadCurve2D .  The iterator for this class is not multi - threaded safe ,  which means that this QuadCurve2D class does not guarantee that modifications to the geometry of this QuadCurve2D object do not affect any iterations of that geometry that are already in process .

Sets a sample in the specified band for the pixel located at (x , y )  in the DataBuffer using a double for input .  The default implementation of this method casts the input double sample to an int and then calls the setSample(int ,  int ,  int ,  DataBuffer )  method using that int value .  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException may be thrown if the coordinates are not in bounds . 
Creates a new NamedValue object initialized with the given flag and adds it to the end of this NVList object .  The flag can be any one of the argument passing modes: ARG _ IN . value ,  ARG _ OUT . value ,  or ARG _ INOUT . value .

Returns the size of the divider . 
Sets the button to pressed or unpressed . 
Processes action events occurring on this text field by dispatching them to any registered ActionListener objects .  This method is not called unless action events are enabled for this component .  Action events are enabled when one of the following occurs: An ActionListener object is registered via addActionListener .  Action events are enabled via enableEvents .  Note that if the event parameter is null the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception . 
Returns true if the element is a synthesized element .  Currently we are only testing for the p - implied tag . 
Appends the chronology name to the formatter .  The calendar system name will be output during a format .  If the chronology cannot be obtained then an exception will be thrown . 
Compass - direction north - east (upper right ) .
Sets the autoscrolls property. If true mouse dragged events will be synthetically generated when the mouse is dragged outside of the component's bounds and mouse motion has paused (while the button continues to be held down ) . The synthetic events make it appear that the drag gesture has resumed in the direction established when the component's boundary was crossed. Components that support autoscrolling must handle mouseDragged events by calling scrollRectToVisible with a rectangle that contains the mouse event's location. All of the Swing components that support item selection and are typically displayed in a JScrollPane (JTable, JList, JTree, JTextArea, and JEditorPane )  already handle mouse dragged events in this way. To enable autoscrolling in any other component, add a mouse motion listener that calls scrollRectToVisible. For example, given a JPanel, myPanel: MouseMotionListener doScrollRectToVisible = new MouseMotionAdapter( )  { public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e )  { Rectangle r = new Rectangle(e.getX( ) , e.getY( ) , 1, 1 ) ; ((JPanel ) e.getSource( )  ) .scrollRectToVisible(r ) ; } }; myPanel.addMouseMotionListener(doScrollRectToVisible ) ; The default value of the autoScrolls property is false.
Returns true if the table draws vertical lines between cells ,  false if it doesn't .  The default value is look and feel dependent . 
The ObjectFactoryBuilder determines the policy used when trying to load object factories .  See getObjectInstance( )  and class ObjectFactory for a description of the default policy .  setObjectFactoryBuilder( )  overrides this default policy by installing an ObjectFactoryBuilder .  Subsequent object factories will be loaded and created using the installed builder .  The builder can only be installed if the executing thread is allowed (by the security manager's checkSetFactory( )  method )  to do so .  Once installed ,  the builder cannot be replaced . 
Relative bulk get method .  This method transfers doubles from this buffer into the given destination array .  If there are fewer doubles remaining in the buffer than are required to satisfy the request, that is, if length > remaining( ) , then no doubles are transferred and a BufferUnderflowException is thrown .  Otherwise, this method copies length doubles from this buffer into the given array, starting at the current position of this buffer and at the given offset in the array .  The position of this buffer is then incremented by length .  In other words, an invocation of this method of the form src . get(dst, off, len )  has exactly the same effect as the loop for (int i = off; i < off + len; i++ )  dst [ i ]  = src . get( ) : except that it first checks that there are sufficient doubles in this buffer and it is potentially much more efficient . 
Returns a copy of this date - time changing the zone offset to the later of the two valid offsets at a local time - line overlap .  This method only has any effect when the local time - line overlaps ,  such as at an autumn daylight savings cutover .  In this scenario ,  there are two valid offsets for the local date - time .  Calling this method will return a zoned date - time with the later of the two selected .  If this method is called when it is not an overlap ,  this is returned .  This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .

An attribute specifying ,  as part of the text declaration ,  the encoding of this entity ,  when it is an external parsed entity .  This is null otherwise . 
Updates this component .  If this component is not a lightweight component, the AWT calls the update method in response to a call to repaint .  You can assume that the background is not cleared .  The update method of Component calls this component's paint method to redraw this component .  This method is commonly overridden by subclasses which need to do additional work in response to a call to repaint .  Subclasses of Component that override this method should either call super . update(g ) , or call paint(g )  directly from their update method .  The origin of the graphics context, its (0, 0 )  coordinate point, is the top - left corner of this component .  The clipping region of the graphics context is the bounding rectangle of this component .  Note: For more information on the paint mechanisms utilitized by AWT and Swing, including information on how to write the most efficient painting code, see Painting in AWT and Swing .

Adds a PropertyChange listener .  Containers and attached components use these methods to register interest in this Action object .  When its enabled state or other property changes ,  the registered listeners are informed of the change . 
Determines whether the JComboBox field is editable .  An editable JComboBox allows the user to type into the field or selected an item from the list to initialize the field ,  after which it can be edited .  (The editing affects only the field ,  the list item remains intact .  )  A non editable JComboBox displays the selected item in the field ,  but the selection cannot be modified .

Value to indicate units of dots per inch (dpi ) . It is actually the conversion factor by which to multiply dpi to yield dphi (100 ) .
Returns a data element array representation of a pixel in this ColorModel ,  given an array of unnormalized color/alpha components .  This array can then be passed to the setDataElements method of a WritableRaster object .  An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown if the components array is not large enough to hold all the color and alpha components ,  starting at offset .  If the obj variable is null ,  a new array is allocated .  If obj is not null ,  it must be a primitive array of type transferType; otherwise ,  a ClassCastException is thrown .  An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown if obj is not large enough to hold a pixel value for this ColorModel .  Since DirectColorModel can be subclassed ,  subclasses inherit the implementation of this method and if they don't override it then they throw an exception if they use an unsupported transferType . 
Opens a datagram channel . 
Returns a new CompletionStage that ,  when this and the other given stage complete normally ,  is executed using the supplied executor ,  with the two results as arguments to the supplied function . 
Returns true if and only if the specified class was dynamically generated to be a proxy class using the getProxyClass method or the newProxyInstance method .  The reliability of this method is important for the ability to use it to make security decisions ,  so its implementation should not just test if the class in question extends Proxy .

Extracts the integer value from this DynAny .  The IDL long data type is mapped to the Java int data type . 
Returns the progress bound property . 
Returns the current hash code of this buffer .  The hash code of a double buffer depends only upon its remaining elements; that is ,  upon the elements from position ( ) up to ,  and including ,  the element at limit ( ) - 1 .  Because buffer hash codes are content-dependent ,  it is inadvisable to use buffers as keys in hash maps or similar data structures unless it is known that their contents will not change . 
Marshal the content tree rooted at jaxbElement into SAX2 events .

This method is invoked for the current security manager by the accept method of class ServerSocket .  This method calls checkPermission with the SocketPermission ( host+"":""+port , ""accept"" )  permission .  If you override this method ,  then you should make a call to super . checkAccept at the point the overridden method would normally throw an exception . "
Returns the base 10 logarithm of a double value .  Special cases: If the argument is NaN or less than zero ,  then the result is NaN .  If the argument is positive infinity ,  then the result is positive infinity .  If the argument is positive zero or negative zero ,  then the result is negative infinity .

Converts this date to the Epoch Day. The Epoch Day count is a simple incrementing count of days where day 0 is 1970 - 01 - 01 (ISO ) . This definition is the same for all chronologies ,  enabling conversion. This default implementation queries the EPOCH _ DAY field.
Returns the component in the currently selected path which contains sourcePoint . 
Returns a copy of this date - time with the specified amount added. This returns a ZonedDateTime ,  based on this one ,  with the specified amount added. The amount is typically Period or Duration but may be any other type implementing the TemporalAmount interface. The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling TemporalAmount.addTo ( Temporal ) . The amount implementation is free to implement the addition in any way it wishes ,  however it typically calls back to plus ( long ,  TemporalUnit ) . Consult the documentation of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully added. This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

In order to maintain backwards compatibility with existing service providers ,  this method cannot be abstract and by default throws an UnsupportedOperationException . 
Returns the data arrays for all banks. Note that calling this method may cause this DataBuffer object to be incompatible with performance optimizations used by some implementations (such as caching an associated image in video memory ) .
Obtains the current status of the voices produced by this synthesizer. If this class of Synthesizer does not provide voice information ,  the returned array will always be of length 0. Otherwise ,  its length is always equal to the total number of voices ,  as returned by getMaxPolyphony( ) . (See the VoiceStatus class description for an explanation of synthesizer voices. ) 
NOTE: The Event class is obsolete and is available only for backwards compatibility .  It has been replaced by the AWTEvent class and its subclasses .  Creates an instance of Event with the specified target component ,  event type ,  and argument . 
Constructs a RealmCallback with a prompt and default realm information . 
Returns the alignment along the y axis .  This specifies how the component would like to be aligned relative to other components .

"Check if this Handler would actually log a given LogRecord into its internal buffer .  This method checks if the LogRecord has an appropriate level and whether it satisfies any Filter .  However it does not check whether the LogRecord would result in a ""push"" of the buffer contents .  It will return false if the LogRecord is null . "
Creates a new object of the same class as this object . 
Place the component in the corner of its display area where the first line of text on a page would normally begin for the current ComponentOrientation .  Equal to NORTHWEST for horizontal ,  left - to - right orientations and NORTHEAST for horizontal ,  right - to - left orientations . 
Compacts this buffer (optional operation ) . The longs between the buffer's current position and its limit ,  if any ,  are copied to the beginning of the buffer. That is ,  the long at index p = position( )  is copied to index zero ,  the long at index p + 1 is copied to index one ,  and so forth until the long at index limit( )  - 1 is copied to index n = limit( )  - 1 - p. The buffer's position is then set to n+1 and its limit is set to its capacity. The mark ,  if defined ,  is discarded. The buffer's position is set to the number of longs copied ,  rather than to zero ,  so that an invocation of this method can be followed immediately by an invocation of another relative put method.
The HTTP method (GET , POST , PUT , etc. ) .
Invoked when a problem is found .

Returns the hash code value for this object . 
Called by the AWT to notify the KeyboardFocusManager that it should delay dispatching of KeyEvents until the specified Component becomes the focus owner .  If client code requests a focus change ,  and the AWT determines that this request might be granted by the native windowing system ,  then the AWT will call this method .  It is the responsibility of the KeyboardFocusManager to delay dispatching of KeyEvents with timestamps later than the specified time stamp until the specified Component receives a FOCUS _ GAINED event ,  or the AWT cancels the delay request by invoking dequeueKeyEvents or discardKeyEvents . 
A change flag indicates that the HIERARCHY _ CHANGED event was generated by a reparenting operation .

Determines the minimum size of the target container using this layout manager .  This method is called when a container calls its getMinimumSize method .  Most applications do not call this method directly . 
Checks if the specified field is supported .  This checks if the date - time can be queried for the specified field .  If false ,  then calling the range and get methods will throw an exception . 
The current event phase is the bubbling phase . 
Obtains the current ISO local date from the system clock in the specified time - zone .  This will query the system clock to obtain the current date .  Specifying the time - zone avoids dependence on the default time - zone .  Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing because the clock is hard - coded . 
Creates a ReflectionException that wraps the actual java . lang . Exception with a detail message . 
Sets whether the JInternalFrame can be resized by some user action . 
Constructs a SQLClientInfoException object initialized with a given reason and failedProperties .  The SQLState is initialized to null and the vendor code is initialized to 0 .

Returns the result of accumulating the given transformation of all (key ,  value )  pairs using the given reducer to combine values ,  and the given basis as an identity value . 
"Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue. The elements are in no particular order. The returned array will be ""safe"" in that no references to it are maintained by this queue. (In other words ,  this method must allocate a new array ) . The caller is thus free to modify the returned array. This method acts as bridge between array - based and collection - based APIs."
The X coordinate of this Point .  If no X coordinate is set it will default to 0 . 
The color blue .  In the default sRGB space . 
Resolves parsed ChronoField values into a date during parsing .  Most TemporalField implementations are resolved using the resolve method on the field .  By contrast ,  the ChronoField class defines fields that only have meaning relative to the chronology .  As such ,  ChronoField date fields are resolved here in the context of a specific chronology .  ChronoField instances are resolved by this method ,  which may be overridden in subclasses .  EPOCH _ DAY - If present ,  this is converted to a date and all other date fields are then cross-checked against the date .  PROLEPTIC _ MONTH - If present ,  then it is split into the YEAR and MONTH _ OF _ YEAR .  If the mode is strict or smart then the field is validated .  YEAR _ OF _ ERA and ERA - If both are present ,  then they are combined to form a YEAR .  In lenient mode ,  the YEAR _ OF _ ERA range is not validated ,  in smart and strict mode it is .  The ERA is validated for range in all three modes .  If only the YEAR _ OF _ ERA is present ,  and the mode is smart or lenient ,  then the last available era is assumed .  In strict mode ,  no era is assumed and the YEAR _ OF _ ERA is left untouched .  If only the ERA is present ,  then it is left untouched .  YEAR ,  MONTH _ OF _ YEAR and DAY _ OF _ MONTH - If all three are present ,  then they are combined to form a date .  In all three modes ,  the YEAR is validated .  If the mode is smart or strict ,  then the month and day are validated .  If the mode is lenient ,  then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first day of the first month in the requested year ,  then adding the difference in months ,  then the difference in days .  If the mode is smart ,  and the day-of-month is greater than the maximum for the year-month ,  then the day-of-month is adjusted to the last day-of-month .  If the mode is strict ,  then the three fields must form a valid date .  YEAR and DAY _ OF _ YEAR - If both are present ,  then they are combined to form a date .  In all three modes ,  the YEAR is validated .  If the mode is lenient ,  then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first day of the requested year ,  then adding the difference in days .  If the mode is smart or strict ,  then the two fields must form a valid date .  YEAR ,  MONTH _ OF _ YEAR ,  ALIGNED _ WEEK _ OF _ MONTH and ALIGNED _ DAY _ OF _ WEEK _ IN _ MONTH - If all four are present ,  then they are combined to form a date .  In all three modes ,  the YEAR is validated .  If the mode is lenient ,  then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first day of the first month in the requested year ,  then adding the difference in months ,  then the difference in weeks ,  then in days .  If the mode is smart or strict ,  then the all four fields are validated to their outer ranges .  The date is then combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first day of the requested year and month ,  then adding the amount in weeks and days to reach their values .  If the mode is strict ,  the date is additionally validated to check that the day and week adjustment did not change the month .  YEAR ,  MONTH _ OF _ YEAR ,  ALIGNED _ WEEK _ OF _ MONTH and DAY _ OF _ WEEK - If all four are present ,  then they are combined to form a date .  The approach is the same as described above for years ,  months and weeks in ALIGNED _ DAY _ OF _ WEEK _ IN _ MONTH .  The day-of-week is adjusted as the next or same matching day-of-week once the years ,  months and weeks have been handled .  YEAR ,  ALIGNED _ WEEK _ OF _ YEAR and ALIGNED _ DAY _ OF _ WEEK _ IN _ YEAR - If all three are present ,  then they are combined to form a date .  In all three modes ,  the YEAR is validated .  If the mode is lenient ,  then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first day of the requested year ,  then adding the difference in weeks ,  then in days .  If the mode is smart or strict ,  then the all three fields are validated to their outer ranges .  The date is then combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first day of the requested year ,  then adding the amount in weeks and days to reach their values .  If the mode is strict ,  the date is additionally validated to check that the day and week adjustment did not change the year .  YEAR ,  ALIGNED _ WEEK _ OF _ YEAR and DAY _ OF _ WEEK - If all three are present ,  then they are combined to form a date .  The approach is the same as described above for years and weeks in ALIGNED _ DAY _ OF _ WEEK _ IN _ YEAR .  The day-of-week is adjusted as the next or same matching day-of-week once the years and weeks have been handled .  The default implementation is suitable for most calendar systems .  If ChronoField . YEAR _ OF _ ERA is found without an ChronoField . ERA then the last era in Chronology . eras ( ) is used .  The implementation assumes a 7 day week ,  that the first day-of-month has the value 1 ,  that first day-of-year has the value 1 ,  and that the first of the month and year always exists .

Returns a ResultSet object containing the original value of this CachedRowSet object .  The cursor for the ResultSet object should be positioned before the first row .  In addition ,  the returned ResultSet object should have the following properties: ResultSet . TYPE _ SCROLL _ INSENSITIVE ResultSet . CONCUR _ UPDATABLE The original value for a RowSet object is the value it had before the last synchronization with the underlying data source .  If there have been no synchronizations ,  the original value will be the value with which the RowSet object was populated .  This method is called internally when an application calls the method acceptChanges and the SyncProvider object has been implemented to check for conflicts .  If this is the case ,  the writer compares the original value with the value currently in the data source to check for conflicts .

Creates a new, empty map with an initial table size based on the given number of elements (initialCapacity ) , table density (loadFactor ) , and number of concurrently updating threads (concurrencyLevel ) .
Returns a hash code value for the object .  This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by HashMap .  The general contract of hashCode is: Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application ,  the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer ,  provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified .  This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application .  If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object )  method ,  then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result .  It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the Object . equals(java . lang . Object )  method ,  then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results .  However ,  the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables .  As much as is reasonably practical ,  the hashCode method defined by class Object does return distinct integers for distinct objects .  (This is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer ,  but this implementation technique is not required by the Javaâ„¢ programming language .  )

These values for the THREADING key are: null - The engine implementation is not thread safe ,  and cannot be used to execute scripts concurrently on multiple threads .  ""MULTITHREADED"" - The engine implementation is internally thread-safe and scripts may execute concurrently although effects of script execution on one thread may be visible to scripts on other threads .  ""THREAD-ISOLATED"" - The implementation satisfies the requirements of ""MULTITHREADED"" ,  and also ,  the engine maintains independent values for symbols in scripts executing on different threads .  ""STATELESS"" - The implementation satisfies the requirements of ""THREAD-ISOLATED"" .  In addition ,  script executions do not alter the mappings in the Bindings which is the engine scope of the ScriptEngine .  In particular ,  the keys in the Bindings and their associated values are the same before and after the execution of the script .  Implementations may define implementation-specific keys . "

""CANONICAL"" is not permitted and an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown. This method returns Strings in the format as specified in getName(String )  and also emits additional attribute type keywords for OIDs that have entries in the oidMap parameter. OID entries in the oidMap take precedence over the default OIDs recognized by getName(String ) . Improperly specified OIDs are ignored; however if an OID in the name maps to an improperly specified keyword ,  an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. Additional standard formats may be introduced in the future. Warning: additional attribute type keywords may not be recognized by other implementations; therefore do not use this method if you are unsure if these keywords will be recognized by other implementations."

Requests that the initiator's credentials be delegated to the acceptor during context establishment .  This request can only be made on the context initiator's side and it has to be done prior to the first call to initSecContext .  Not all mechanisms support credential delegation .  Therefore ,  an application that desires delegation should check to see if the request was honored with the getCredDelegState method .  If the application indicates that delegation must not be used ,  then the mechanism will honor the request and delegation will not occur .  This is an exception to the general rule that a mechanism may enable a service even if it is not requested .

Returns a string with the name and the version number of this provider . 
Sets the opacity of the window. The opacity value is in the range [0..1 ] . Note that setting the opacity level of 0 may or may not disable the mouse event handling on this window. This is a platform - dependent behavior. The following conditions must be met in order to set the opacity value less than 1.0f: The TRANSLUCENT translucency must be supported by the underlying system The window must be undecorated (see setUndecorated(boolean )  and Dialog.setUndecorated(boolean )  )  The window must not be in full - screen mode (see GraphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindow(Window )  )  If the requested opacity value is less than 1.0f ,  and any of the above conditions are not met ,  the window opacity will not change ,  and the IllegalComponentStateException will be thrown. The translucency levels of individual pixels may also be effected by the alpha component of their color (see Window.setBackground(Color )  )  and the current shape of this window (see Window.setShape(Shape )  ) .

"Obtain a new instance of a JAXBContext class. The client application must supply a list of classes that the new context object needs to recognize. Not only the new context will recognize all the classes specified, but it will also recognize any classes that are directly/indirectly referenced statically from the specified classes. Subclasses of referenced classes nor @XmlTransient referenced classes are not registered with JAXBContext. For example, in the following Java code, if you do newInstance(Foo.class ) , the newly created JAXBContext will recognize both Foo and Bar, but not Zot or FooBar: class Foo { @XmlTransient FooBar c; Bar b; } class Bar { int x; } class Zot extends Bar { int y; } class FooBar { } Therefore, a typical client application only needs to specify the top - level classes, but it needs to be careful. Note that for each java package registered with JAXBContext, when the optional package annotations exist, they must be processed. (see JLS, Section 7.4.1 ""Named Packages"" ) . The steps involved in discovering the JAXB implementation is discussed in the class javadoc."
Retrieves whether this database treats mixed case quoted SQL identifiers as case insensitive and stores them in lower case . 
"Returns a class loader that loads classes from the given codebase URL path .  The class loader returned is the class loader that the loadClass ( String , String )  method would use to load classes for the same codebase argument .  This method delegates to the RMIClassLoaderSpi . getClassLoader ( String )  method of the provider instance ,  passing codebase as the argument .  If there is a security manger ,  its checkPermission method will be invoked with a RuntimePermission ( ""getClassLoader"" )  permission; this could result in a SecurityException .  The provider implementation of this method may also perform further security checks to verify that the calling context has permission to connect to all of the URLs in the codebase URL path . "
Updates the designated column with a String value .  It is intended for use when updating NCHAR , NVARCHAR and LONGNVARCHAR columns .  The updater methods are used to update column values in the current row or the insert row .

Adds or subtracts (up/down )  a single unit of time on the given time field without changing larger fields. For example ,  to roll the current date up by one day ,  you can achieve it by calling: roll(Calendar.DATE ,  true ) . When rolling on the year or Calendar.YEAR field ,  it will roll the year value in the range between 1 and the value returned by calling getMaximum(Calendar.YEAR ) . When rolling on the month or Calendar.MONTH field ,  other fields like date might conflict and ,  need to be changed. For instance ,  rolling the month on the date 01/31/96 will result in 02/29/96. When rolling on the hour - in - day or Calendar.HOUR _ OF _ DAY field ,  it will roll the hour value in the range between 0 and 23 ,  which is zero - based.
Type for secret keys . 
Gets the range of valid values for the specified field .  The range object expresses the minimum and maximum valid values for a field .  This time is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range .  If it is not possible to return the range ,  because the field is not supported or for some other reason ,  an exception is thrown .  If the field is a ChronoField then the query is implemented here .  The supported fields will return appropriate range instances .  All other ChronoField instances will throw an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException .  If the field is not a ChronoField ,  then the result of this method is obtained by invoking TemporalField . rangeRefinedBy ( TemporalAccessor )  passing this as the argument .  Whether the range can be obtained is determined by the field .

Returns true if the arguments are deeply equal to each other and false otherwise .  Two null values are deeply equal .  If both arguments are arrays ,  the algorithm in Arrays . deepEquals is used to determine equality .  Otherwise ,  equality is determined by using the equals method of the first argument . 
Gets the kind of this tree . 
Returns a shallow clone of this instance .  The clone is obtained by simply calling super . clone ( ) ,  thus calling the default native shallow cloning mechanism implemented by Object . clone ( ) .  No deeper cloning of any internal field is made .  Since this class is immutable ,  cloning is chiefly of interest to subclasses . 
Continues a multiple - part encryption or decryption operation (depending on how this cipher was initialized ) , processing another data part .  The first inputLen bytes in the input buffer, starting at inputOffset inclusive, are processed, and the result is stored in the output buffer .  If the output buffer is too small to hold the result, a ShortBufferException is thrown .  In this case, repeat this call with a larger output buffer .  Use getOutputSize to determine how big the output buffer should be .  If inputLen is zero, this method returns a length of zero .  Note: this method should be copy - safe, which means the input and output buffers can reference the same byte array and no unprocessed input data is overwritten when the result is copied into the output buffer . 
Returns the bounding rectangle ,  in the list's coordinate system ,  for the range of cells specified by the two indices .  These indices can be supplied in any order .  If the smaller index is outside the list's range of cells ,  this method returns null .  If the smaller index is valid ,  but the larger index is outside the list's range ,  the bounds of just the first index is returned .  Otherwise ,  the bounds of the valid range is returned .  This is a cover method that delegates to the method of the same name in the list's ListUI .  It returns null if the list has no ListUI . 
Adds a service provider object to the registry .  The provider is associated with the given category .  If provider implements the RegisterableService interface ,  its onRegistration method will be called .  Its onDeregistration method will be called each time it is deregistered from a category ,  for example if a category is removed or the registry is garbage collected . 
Invoked by BeanContextServices ,  this method releases a nested BeanContextChild's (or any arbitrary object associated with a BeanContextChild )  reference to the specified service . 
Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket to listen for connections .  This method is used to establish an association between the socket and a local address .  Once an association is established then the socket remains bound until the associated channel is closed .  The backlog parameter is the maximum number of pending connections on the socket .  Its exact semantics are implementation specific .  In particular ,  an implementation may impose a maximum length or may choose to ignore the parameter altogther .  If the backlog parameter has the value 0 ,  or a negative value ,  then an implementation specific default is used . 
Configures the engine to use client (or server )  mode when handshaking .  This method must be called before any handshaking occurs .  Once handshaking has begun ,  the mode can not be reset for the life of this engine .  Servers normally authenticate themselves ,  and clients are not required to do so . 
Visits an executable element . 
Writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset off to this buffered output stream .  Ordinarily this method stores bytes from the given array into this stream's buffer ,  flushing the buffer to the underlying output stream as needed .  If the requested length is at least as large as this stream's buffer ,  however ,  then this method will flush the buffer and write the bytes directly to the underlying output stream .  Thus redundant BufferedOutputStreams will not copy data unnecessarily . 
Specifies the domain within which this cookie should be presented. The form of the domain name is specified by RFC 2965. A domain name begins with a dot (.foo.com )  and means that the cookie is visible to servers in a specified Domain Name System (DNS )  zone (for example ,  www.foo.com ,  but not a.b.foo.com ) . By default ,  cookies are only returned to the server that sent them.

Retrieves the response controls produced as a result of the last method invoked on this context .  The response controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are immutable .  Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the caller .  These response controls might have been generated by a successful or failed operation .  When a context method that may return response controls is invoked ,  response controls from the previous method invocation are cleared .  getResponseControls( )  returns all of the response controls generated by LDAP operations used by the context method in the order received from the LDAP server .  Invoking getResponseControls( )  does not clear the response controls .  You can call it many times (and get back the same controls )  until the next context method that may return controls is invoked .

Relative bulk put method (optional operation ) . This method transfers bytes into this buffer from the given source array. If there are more bytes to be copied from the array than remain in this buffer, that is, if length > remaining( ) , then no bytes are transferred and a BufferOverflowException is thrown. Otherwise, this method copies length bytes from the given array into this buffer, starting at the given offset in the array and at the current position of this buffer. The position of this buffer is then incremented by length. In other words, an invocation of this method of the form dst.put(src, off, len )  has exactly the same effect as the loop for (int i = off; i < off + len; i++ )  dst.put(a [ i ]  ) ; except that it first checks that there is sufficient space in this buffer and it is potentially much more efficient.
The minimum value of a Unicode surrogate code unit in the UTF - 16 encoding ,  constant '\uD800' .

Creates an object that encapsulates the current execution environment .  The result of this method is used ,  for example ,  by the three - argument checkConnect method and by the two - argument checkRead method .  These methods are needed because a trusted method may be called on to read a file or open a socket on behalf of another method .  The trusted method needs to determine if the other (possibly untrusted )  method would be allowed to perform the operation on its own .  The default implementation of this method is to return an AccessControlContext object .

Atomically increments by one the element at index i . 
Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from a subsequence of the given buffers. An attempt is made to write up to r bytes to this channel ,  where r is the total number of bytes remaining in the specified subsequence of the given buffer array ,  that is ,  srcs [ offset ] .remaining ( ) + srcs [ offset+1 ] .remaining ( ) + ... + srcs [ offset+length - 1 ] .remaining ( ) at the moment that this method is invoked. Suppose that a byte sequence of length n is written ,  where 0 <= n <= r. Up to the first srcs [ offset ] .remaining ( ) bytes of this sequence are written from buffer srcs [ offset ]  ,  up to the next srcs [ offset+1 ] .remaining ( ) bytes are written from buffer srcs [ offset+1 ]  ,  and so forth ,  until the entire byte sequence is written. As many bytes as possible are written from each buffer ,  hence the final position of each updated buffer ,  except the last updated buffer ,  is guaranteed to be equal to that buffer's limit. Unless otherwise specified ,  a write operation will return only after writing all of the r requested bytes. Some types of channels ,  depending upon their state ,  may write only some of the bytes or possibly none at all. A socket channel in non - blocking mode ,  for example ,  cannot write any more bytes than are free in the socket's output buffer. This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has already initiated a write operation upon this channel ,  however ,  then an invocation of this method will block until the first operation is complete.

"Determines whether obj is syntactically equal to this compound name .  If obj is null or not a CompoundName ,  false is returned .  Two compound names are equal if each component in one is ""equal"" to the corresponding component in the other .  Equality is also defined in terms of the syntax of this compound name .  The default implementation of CompoundName uses the syntax properties jndi . syntax . ignorecase and jndi . syntax . trimblanks when comparing two components for equality .  If case is ignored ,  two strings with the same sequence of characters but with different cases are considered equal .  If blanks are being trimmed ,  leading and trailing blanks are ignored for the purpose of the comparison .  Both compound names must have the same number of components .  Implementation note: Currently the syntax properties of the two compound names are not compared for equality .  They might be in the future . "
Sets the TreeModel . 
"String representation of this QName. The commonly accepted way of representing a QName as a String was defined by James Clark. Although this is not a standard specification ,  it is in common use ,  e.g. Transformer.setParameter ( String name ,  Object value). This implementation represents a QName as: ""{"" + Namespace URI + ""}"" + local part. If the Namespace URI .equals ( XMLConstants.NULL _ NS _ URI) ,  only the local part is returned. An appropriate use of this method is for debugging or logging for human consumption. Note the prefix value is NOT returned as part of the String representation. This method satisfies the general contract of Object.toString ( )."
Return the byte or character offset into the input source this location is pointing to .  If the input source is a file or a byte stream then this is the byte offset into that stream ,  but if the input source is a character media then the offset is the character offset .

InputSource ,  where the characters in the stream represent the unicode code points for XML according to section 2 and appendix B of the XML 1 . 0 specification .  Although an encoding declaration other than unicode may be present ,  the encoding of the stream is unicode .  The behavior of this method is the same as ResultSet . updateCharacterStream ( ) when the designated column of the ResultSet has a type java . sql . Types of SQLXML .  The SQL XML object becomes not writeable when this method is called and may also become not readable depending on implementation .

Returns a Collection of CRLs that match the specified selector .  If no CRLs match the selector ,  an empty Collection will be returned .  For some CertStore types ,  the resulting Collection may not contain all of the CRLs that match the selector .  For instance ,  an LDAP CertStore may not search all entries in the directory .  Instead ,  it may just search entries that are likely to contain the CRLs it is looking for .  Some CertStore implementations (especially LDAP CertStores )  may throw a CertStoreException unless a non - null CRLSelector is provided that includes specific criteria that can be used to find the CRLs .  Issuer names and/or the certificate to be checked are especially useful . 
Returns the next token from this string tokenizer . 
Writes a sequence of doubles to the stream at the current position .  If len is 0 ,  nothing is written .  The double d [ off ]  is written first ,  then the double d [ off + 1 ]  ,  and so on .  The byte order of the stream is used to determine the order in which the individual bytes are written .  If the bit offset within the stream is non - zero ,  the remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s and written out first .  The bit offset will be 0 after the write . 
Set the default stream for new logs . 
This protected field is implementation specific .  Do not access directly or override .

"Adds the the given synchronization provider to the factory register .  Guidelines are provided in the SyncProvider specification for the required naming conventions for SyncProvider implementations .  Synchronization providers bound to a JNDI context can be registered by binding a SyncProvider instance to a JNDI namespace .  SyncProvider p = new MySyncProvider( ) ; InitialContext ic = new InitialContext( ) ; ic . bind (""jdbc/rowset/MySyncProvider"" ,  p ) ; Furthermore ,  an initial JNDI context should be set with the SyncFactory using the setJNDIContext method .  The SyncFactory leverages this context to search for available SyncProvider objects bound to the JNDI context and its child nodes . "
Retrieves ,  but does not remove ,  the head of the queue represented by this deque .  This method differs from peek only in that it throws an exception if this deque is empty .  This method is equivalent to getFirst ( ) . 
Creates a localized description of this throwable .  Subclasses may override this method in order to produce a locale - specific message .  For subclasses that do not override this method ,  the default implementation returns the same result as getMessage ( ) . 
Return the system default cursor . 
If an event is cancelable ,  the preventDefault method is used to signify that the event is to be canceled ,  meaning any default action normally taken by the implementation as a result of the event will not occur .  If ,  during any stage of event flow ,  the preventDefault method is called the event is canceled .  Any default action associated with the event will not occur .  Calling this method for a non - cancelable event has no effect .  Once preventDefault has been called it will remain in effect throughout the remainder of the event's propagation .  This method may be used during any stage of event flow . 
During mouse events caused by the depression or release of a mouse button ,  button is used to indicate which mouse button changed state .  The values for button range from zero to indicate the left button of the mouse ,  one to indicate the middle button if present ,  and two to indicate the right button .  For mice configured for left handed use in which the button actions are reversed the values are instead read from right to left .

This returns a LocalDateTime with the specified year ,  month ,  day - of - month ,  hour ,  minute and second .  The day must be valid for the year and month ,  otherwise an exception will be thrown .  The nanosecond field will be set to zero . 
Returns the maximum bounds for centered Windows .  These bounds account for objects in the native windowing system such as task bars and menu bars .  The returned bounds will reside on a single display with one exception: on multi - screen systems where Windows should be centered across all displays ,  this method returns the bounds of the entire display area .  To get the usable bounds of a single display ,  use GraphicsConfiguration . getBounds ( ) and Toolkit . getScreenInsets ( ) .

A new MessageDigest object encapsulating the MessageDigestSpi implementation from the specified Provider object is returned .  Note that the specified Provider object does not have to be registered in the provider list . 
Adds a Component to this Group with the specified size . 
Drop membership .  If the membership key represents a membership to receive all datagrams then the membership is dropped and the channel will no longer receive any datagrams sent to the group .  If the membership key is source - specific then the channel will no longer receive datagrams sent to the group from that source address .  After membership is dropped it may still be possible to receive datagrams sent to the group .  This can arise when datagrams are waiting to be received in the socket's receive buffer .  After membership is dropped then the channel may join the group again in which case a new membership key is returned .  Upon return ,  this membership object will be invalid .  If the multicast group membership is already invalid then invoking this method has no effect .  Once a multicast group membership is invalid ,  it remains invalid forever . 
Gets the number of children for the element . 
Sets the designated parameter to the given java . sql . Date object .  When the DBMS does not store time zone information ,  the driver will use the given Calendar object to construct the SQL DATE value to send to the database .  With a Calendar object ,  the driver can calculate the date taking into account a custom time zone .  If no Calendar object is specified ,  the driver uses the time zone of the Virtual Machine that is running the application .  The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this RowSet object's command when the method execute is called .  Methods such as execute and populate must be provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or more of the standard JSR-114 RowSet interfaces .  NOTE: JdbcRowSet does not require the populate method as it is undefined in this class .  Calls made to the method getParams after this version of setDate has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that have been set .  In that array ,  the element that represents the values set with this method will itself be an array .  The first element of that array is the given java . sql . Date object .  The second element is the value set for cal .  The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array returned by the method getParams ,  with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter ,  the second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter ,  and so on .  In other words ,  if the date being set is the value for the second placeholder parameter ,  the array containing it will be the second element in the array returned by getParams .  Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero ,  the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number parameterIndex is parameterIndex -1 . 
letter transparency .

"Informs the system that the object with the corresponding activation id is currently inactive .  If the object is currently active ,  the object is ""unexported"" from the RMI runtime (only if there are no pending or in - progress calls )  so the that it can no longer receive incoming calls .  This call informs this VM's ActivationGroup that the object is inactive ,  that ,  in turn ,  informs its ActivationMonitor .  If this call completes successfully ,  a subsequent activate request to the activator will cause the object to reactivate .  The operation may still succeed if the object is considered active but has already unexported itself . "

Otherwise ,  the active Window is the first Frame or Dialog that is an owner of the focused Window . 
Returns the alignment of the label's contents along the Y axis . 
Retrieves a result set that contains the elements of the SQL ARRAY value designated by this Array object. This method uses the specified map for type map customizations unless the base type of the array does not match a user - defined type in map ,  in which case it uses the standard mapping. This version of the method getResultSet uses either the given type map or the standard mapping; it never uses the type map associated with the connection. The result set contains one row for each array element ,  with two columns in each row. The second column stores the element value; the first column stores the index into the array for that element (with the first array element being at index 1 ) . The rows are in ascending order corresponding to the order of the indices.
Notifies all listeners that have registered interest for notification on this event type .  The event instance is lazily created using the path parameter . 
Note: this interface is required to permit the safe association of a DropTarget with a Component in one of two ways ,  either: component . setDropTarget ( droptarget ) ; or droptarget . setComponent ( component ) ; The Component will receive drops only if it is enabled . 
Performs the necessary internal configurations and initializations to allow any JDBC RowSet implementation to start using the standard facilities provided by a BaseRowSet instance .  This method should be called after the RowSet object has been instantiated to correctly initialize all parameters .  This method should never be called by an application ,  but is called from with a RowSet implementation extending this class . 
Constructs a new throwable with the specified cause . 
Creates the chronology era object from the numeric value .  The era is ,  conceptually ,  the largest division of the time - line .  Most calendar systems have a single epoch dividing the time - line into two eras .  However ,  some have multiple eras ,  such as one for the reign of each leader .  The exact meaning is determined by the chronology according to the following constraints .  The era in use at 1970 - 01 - 01 must have the value 1 .  Later eras must have sequentially higher values .  Earlier eras must have sequentially lower values .  Each chronology must refer to an enum or similar singleton to provide the era values .  This method returns the singleton era of the correct type for the specified era value . 
Removes the entry for a key only if currently mapped to a given value .  This is equivalent to if (map . containsKey(key )  && Objects . equals(map . get(key ) , value )  )  { map . remove(key ) ; return true; } else return false; except that the action is performed atomically . 
Value for fourth month of year . 
Constructs a AccountException with the specified detail message .  A detail message is a String that describes this particular exception . 
Retrieves the connection request controls in effect for this context .  The controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are immutable .  Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the caller . 
"Sets the default assertion status for this class loader to false and discards any package defaults or class assertion status settings associated with the class loader .  This method is provided so that class loaders can be made to ignore any command line or persistent assertion status settings and ""start with a clean slate . """
Compares the specified object with this list for equality. Returns true if and only if the specified object is also a list ,  both lists have the same size ,  and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two lists are equal. (Two elements e1 and e2 are equal if (e1==null ? e2==null : e1.equals(e2 )  ) . )  In other words ,  two lists are defined to be equal if they contain the same elements in the same order. This implementation first checks if the specified object is this list. If so ,  it returns true; if not ,  it checks if the specified object is a list. If not ,  it returns false; if so ,  it iterates over both lists ,  comparing corresponding pairs of elements. If any comparison returns false ,  this method returns false. If either iterator runs out of elements before the other it returns false (as the lists are of unequal length ) ; otherwise it returns true when the iterations complete.
Obtains a List containing all SNIServerNames of the requested Server Name Indication (SNI )  extension .  In server mode ,  unless the return List is empty ,  the server should use the requested server names to guide its selection of an appropriate authentication certificate ,  and/or other aspects of security policy .  In client mode ,  unless the return List is empty ,  the client should use the requested server names to guide its endpoint identification of the peer's identity ,  and/or other aspects of security policy . 
Returns the specified component's preferred size appropriate for the look and feel. If null is returned ,  the preferred size will be calculated by the component's layout manager instead (this is the preferred approach for any component with a specific layout manager installed ) . The default implementation of this method returns null.
Option label for use in hierarchical menus .  See the label attribute definition in HTML 4 . 0 . 
Inserts the specified element into the queue represented by this deque (in other words, at the tail of this deque ) , waiting up to the specified wait time if necessary for space to become available .  This method is equivalent to offerLast . 
Returns a new CompletionStage that ,  when this stage completes either normally or exceptionally ,  is executed using this stage's default asynchronous execution facility ,  with this stage's result and exception as arguments to the supplied function .  When this stage is complete ,  the given function is invoked with the result (or null if none )  and the exception (or null if none )  of this stage as arguments ,  and the function's result is used to complete the returned stage . 
Returns a percentage format for the current default FORMAT locale. This is equivalent to calling getPercentInstance ( Locale.getDefault ( Locale.Category.FORMAT )  ) .
Constructor for derived classes .  The constructor does nothing .  Derived classes must create ValidatorHandler objects that have null ErrorHandler and null LSResourceResolver . 
Returns the number of columns selected . 
Constructs an MBeanNotificationInfo object . 
Resets this Polygon object to an empty polygon .  The coordinate arrays and the data in them are left untouched but the number of points is reset to zero to mark the old vertex data as invalid and to start accumulating new vertex data at the beginning .  All internally - cached data relating to the old vertices are discarded .  Note that since the coordinate arrays from before the reset are reused ,  creating a new empty Polygon might be more memory efficient than resetting the current one if the number of vertices in the new polygon data is significantly smaller than the number of vertices in the data from before the reset . 
Whether or not the drawing buffer has been recently restored from a lost state . 
Constructs an BAD _ QOS exception with the specified minor code and completion status .

Returns the Context for the specified component . 
Used for instances of ImportTree . 
Returns the color space type of this ColorSpace (for example TYPE _ RGB ,  TYPE _ XYZ ,  ... ) . The type defines the number of components of the color space and the interpretation ,  e.g. TYPE _ RGB identifies a color space with three components - red ,  green ,  and blue. It does not define the particular color characteristics of the space ,  e.g. the chromaticities of the primaries.
Returns the BufferedImage to which decoded pixel data should be written. The image is determined by inspecting the supplied ImageReadParam if it is non - null; if its getDestination method returns a non - null value ,  that image is simply returned. Otherwise ,  param.getDestinationType method is called to determine if a particular image type has been specified. If so ,  the returned ImageTypeSpecifier is used after checking that it is equal to one of those included in imageTypes. If param is null or the above steps have not yielded an image or an ImageTypeSpecifier ,  the first value obtained from the imageTypes parameter is used. Typically ,  the caller will set imageTypes to the value of getImageTypes ( imageIndex ) . Next ,  the dimensions of the image are determined by a call to computeRegions. The actual width and height of the image being decoded are passed in as the width and height parameters.
Gets the AccessibleContext associated with this Dialog .  For dialogs ,  the AccessibleContext takes the form of an AccessibleAWTDialog .  A new AccessibleAWTDialog instance is created if necessary .

Used for instances of LiteralTree representing a floating - point literal expression of type float . 
"Gets the accessible description of this object. This should be a concise ,  localized description of what this object is - what is its meaning to the user. If the object has a tooltip ,  the tooltip text may be an appropriate string to return ,  assuming it contains a concise description of the object (instead of just the name of the object - e.g. a ""Save"" icon on a toolbar that had ""save"" as the tooltip text shouldn't return the tooltip text as the description ,  but something like ""Saves the current text document"" instead ) ."
Returns the menu bar value . 
new Proxy Class Descriptor . 
Fetch the font that the glyphs should be based upon .  This is implemented to call StyledDocument . getFont if the associated document is a StyledDocument .  If the associated document is not a StyledDocument ,  the associated components font is used .  If there is no associated component ,  null is returned . 
Calculates and returns the bitwise inclusive OR of the status of all media that are tracked by this media tracker .  Possible flags defined by the MediaTracker class are LOADING ,  ABORTED ,  ERRORED ,  and COMPLETE .  An image that hasn't started loading has zero as its status .  If the value of load is true ,  then this method starts loading any images that are not yet being loaded . 
Gets the AccessibleText associated with this object presenting text on the display . 
The pseudo - type corresponding to the keyword void . 
Is called by the local stub after it has invoked an operation on the local servant that was previously retrieved from a call to the method _servant_preinvoke .  The _servant_postinvoke method must be called if the _servant_preinvoke method returned a non - null value ,  even if an exception was thrown by the method invoked by the servant .  For this reason ,  the call to the method _servant_postinvoke should be placed in a Java finally clause . 
This method gets called when a bound property is changed . 
Atomically updates the current value with the results of applying the given function to the current and given values ,  returning the previous value .  The function should be side - effect - free ,  since it may be re - applied when attempted updates fail due to contention among threads .  The function is applied with the current value as its first argument ,  and the given update as the second argument . 
Constructor to be used for subclasses . 
Creates a new link (directory entry )  for an existing file .  This method works in exactly the manner specified by the Files . createLink(java . nio . file . Path ,  java . nio . file . Path )  method .  The default implementation of this method throws UnsupportedOperationException . 
Choose which rows and columns of the delivered int pixels are needed for the destination scaled image and pass through just those rows and columns that are needed ,  replicated as necessary .  Note: This method is intended to be called by the ImageProducer of the Image whose pixels are being filtered .  Developers using this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling this method directly since that operation could interfere with the filtering operation . 
Returns the Region for the JComponent c . 
"Specifies that the parser produced by this code will validate documents as they are parsed .  By default the value of this is set to false .  Note that ""the validation"" here means a validating parser as defined in the XML recommendation .  In other words ,  it essentially just controls the DTD validation .  (except the legacy two properties defined in JAXP 1 . 2 .  )  To use modern schema languages such as W3C XML Schema or RELAX NG instead of DTD ,  you can configure your parser to be a non - validating parser by leaving the setValidating(boolean )  method false ,  then use the setSchema(Schema )  method to associate a schema to a parser . "
Deletes the text between two indices
The Shift key modifier constant .  It is recommended that SHIFT _ DOWN _ MASK be used instead . 
Generates the next pseudorandom number. Subclasses should override this, as this is used by all other methods. The general contract of next is that it returns an int value and if the argument bits is between 1 and 32 (inclusive ) , then that many low-order bits of the returned value will be (approximately )  independently chosen bit values, each of which is (approximately )  equally likely to be 0 or 1. The method next is implemented by class Random by atomically updating the seed to (seed * 0x5DEECE66DL + 0xBL )  & ((1L << 48 )  - 1 )  and returning (int ) (seed >>> (48 - bits )  ) . This is a linear congruential pseudorandom number generator, as defined by D. H. Lehmer and described by Donald E. Knuth in The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3: Seminumerical Algorithms, section 3.2.1.

Skips any insignificant space events until a START _ ELEMENT or END _ ELEMENT is reached .  If anything other than space characters are encountered ,  an exception is thrown .  This method should be used when processing element - only content because the parser is not able to recognize ignorable whitespace if the DTD is missing or not interpreted . 
The name of the processing instruction that is sent if the result tree enables output escaping at some point after having received a PI _ DISABLE _ OUTPUT _ ESCAPING processing instruction . 
Obtains a Period representing a number of years .  The resulting period will have the specified years .  The months and days units will be zero .

Construct a DragSourceDropEvent for a drop ,  given the DragSourceContext ,  the drop action ,  a boolean indicating if the drop was successful ,  and coordinates .  The argument action should be one of DnDConstants that represents a single action .  This constructor does not throw any exception for invalid action . 
Adds a new attribute node .  If an attribute with that name ( nodeName )  is already present in the element ,  it is replaced by the new one .  Replacing an attribute node by itself has no effect .  To add a new attribute node with a qualified name and namespace URI ,  use the setAttributeNodeNS method . 
Reads an IDL CORBA::Object from the input stream . 
Converts this Interface address to a String .  The string returned is of the form: InetAddress / prefix length [ broadcast address ] . 
Creates a new AccessibleState using the given locale independent key .  This should not be a public method .  Instead ,  it is used to create the constants in this file to make it a strongly typed enumeration .  Subclasses of this class should enforce similar policy .  The key String should be a locale independent key for the state .  It is not intended to be used as the actual String to display to the user .  To get the localized string ,  use toDisplayString . 
This method is called before the popup menu becomes visible
Get an impersonation token for the current NT user . 
Retrieves a stream to be used to write Ascii characters to the CLOB value that this SerialClob object represents ,  starting at position pos .  This method forwards the setAsciiStream ( ) call to the underlying Clob object in the event that this SerialClob object is instantiated with a Clob object .  If this SerialClob object is instantiated with a char array ,  a SerialException object is thrown . 
Removes a VetoableChangeListener from the listener list .  This method should be used to remove the VetoableChangeListeners that were registered for all vetoable properties of this class .  If listener is null ,  no exception is thrown and no action is performed . 
Reverses configuration which was done on the specified component during installUI. This method is invoked when this UIComponent instance is being removed as the UI delegate for the specified component. This method should undo the configuration performed in installUI ,  being careful to leave the JComponent instance in a clean state (no extraneous listeners ,  look - and - feel - specific property objects ,  etc. ) . This should include the following: Remove any UI - set borders from the component. Remove any UI - set layout managers on the component. Remove any UI - added sub - components from the component. Remove any UI - added event/property listeners from the component. Remove any UI - installed keyboard UI from the component. Nullify any allocated instance data objects to allow for GC.
Returns an empty PermissionCollection for a given Permission object ,  or null if one is not defined. Subclasses of class Permission should override this if they need to store their permissions in a particular PermissionCollection object in order to provide the correct semantics when the PermissionCollection.implies method is called. If null is returned ,  then the caller of this method is free to store permissions of this type in any PermissionCollection they choose (one that uses a Hashtable ,  one that uses a Vector ,  etc ) .
Returns a copy of this LocalTime with the minute - of - hour altered .  This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .

Returns the list of UIs associated with this multiplexing UI .  This allows processing of the UIs by an application aware of multiplexing UIs on components . 
Returns the primeQ . 
Creates an object using the location or reference information ,  and attributes specified .  Special requirements of this object are supplied using environment .  An example of such an environment property is user identity information .  DirectoryManager . getObjectInstance ( ) successively loads in object factories .  If it encounters a DirObjectFactory ,  it will invoke DirObjectFactory . getObjectInstance ( ); otherwise ,  it invokes ObjectFactory . getObjectInstance ( ) .  It does this until a factory produces a non - null answer .  When an exception is thrown by an object factory ,  the exception is passed on to the caller of DirectoryManager . getObjectInstance ( ) .  The search for other factories that may produce a non - null answer is halted .  An object factory should only throw an exception if it is sure that it is the only intended factory and that no other object factories should be tried .  If this factory cannot create an object using the arguments supplied ,  it should return null .  Since DirObjectFactory extends ObjectFactory ,  it effectively has two getObjectInstance ( ) methods ,  where one differs from the other by the attributes argument .  Given a factory that implements DirObjectFactory ,  DirectoryManager . getObjectInstance ( ) will only use the method that accepts the attributes argument ,  while NamingManager . getObjectInstance ( ) will only use the one that does not accept the attributes argument .  See ObjectFactory for a description URL context factories and other properties of object factories that apply equally to DirObjectFactory .  The name ,  attrs ,  and environment parameters are owned by the caller .  The implementation will not modify these objects or keep references to them ,  although it may keep references to clones or copies . 
Creates a SocketFactory . 
Remove any value associated with the given name . 
Returns the first tab index with a given title ,  or -1 if no tab has this title . 
Creates a Box that displays its components from left to right .  If you want a Box that respects the component orientation you should create the Box using the constructor and pass in BoxLayout . LINE _ AXIS ,  eg: Box lineBox = new Box ( BoxLayout . LINE _ AXIS ) ;
Gets the Collator for the current default locale .  The default locale is determined by java . util . Locale . getDefault . 
"Uses streams to produce a token containing a cryptographic MIC for the supplied message ,  for transfer to the peer application .  Unlike wrap ,  which encapsulates the user message in the returned token ,  only the message MIC is produced in the output token .  This method is equivalent to the byte array based getMIC method .  Note that privacy can only be applied through the wrap call .  Since some application - level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted by getMIC to provide ""secure framing"" ,  implementations should support derivation of MICs from zero - length messages . "
Returns a copy of this OffsetTime with the specified offset ensuring that the result has the same local time. This method returns an object with the same LocalTime and the specified ZoneOffset. No calculation is needed or performed. For example ,  if this time represents 10:30+02:00 and the offset specified is +03:00 ,  then this method will return 10:30+03:00. To take into account the difference between the offsets ,  and adjust the time fields ,  use withOffsetSameInstant ( java.time.ZoneOffset ) . This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Set the calendar to be used by this date format .  Initially ,  the default calendar for the specified or default locale is used .  Any TimeZone and leniency values that have previously been set are overwritten by newCalendar's values . 
Constructs and initializes a QuadCurve2D from the specified float coordinates . 
Equivalent to getNodeName . 
Returns whether this SyncProvider implementation can perform synchronization between a RowSet object and the SQL VIEW in the data source from which the RowSet object got its data . 
Returns the alignment along the y axis for the container . 
Returns a clone of this DataFlavor . 
Specifies if this feature is enabled or disabled . 
Returns a RenderedImage object that contains the contents of the image indexed by imageIndex. By default, the returned image is simply the BufferedImage returned by read(imageIndex, param ) . The semantics of this method may differ from those of the other read methods in several ways. First, any destination image and/or image type set in the ImageReadParam may be ignored. Second, the usual listener calls are not guaranteed to be made, or to be meaningful if they are. This is because the returned image may not be fully populated with pixel data at the time it is returned, or indeed at any time. If the supplied ImageReadParam contains optional setting values not supported by this reader (e.g. source render size or any format - specific settings ) , they will be ignored. The default implementation just calls read(imageIndex, param ) .
Appends the specified character sequence to this Appendable .  Depending on which class implements the character sequence csq ,  the entire sequence may not be appended .  For instance ,  if csq is a CharBuffer then the subsequence to append is defined by the buffer's position and limit . 
Returns a new CompletionStage that ,  when this stage completes normally ,  is executed using the supplied Executor ,  with this stage's result as the argument to the supplied function .  See the CompletionStage documentation for rules covering exceptional completion . 
Return true if the integer argument includes the abstract modifier ,  false otherwise . 
Returns the BufferCapabilities for this BufferStrategy . 
Checks that the specified value is valid and fits in an int .  This validates that the value is within the valid range of values and that all valid values are within the bounds of an int .  The field is only used to improve the error message .

Gets the local time of day of the transition which must be checked with isMidnightEndOfDay ( ) .  The time is converted into an instant using the time definition . 
Reads a set of file attributes as a bulk operation .  This method works in exactly the manner specified by the Files . readAttributes ( Path , String , LinkOption [ ] )  method . 
Creates an NVList initialized with argument descriptions for the operation described in the given OperationDef object .  This OperationDef object is obtained from an Interface Repository .  The arguments in the returned NVList object are in the same order as in the original IDL operation definition ,  which makes it possible for the list to be used in dynamic invocation requests . 
Receive notification of the start of an element. By default ,  do nothing. Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the start of each element (such as allocating a new tree node or writing output to a file ) .
Generates a key pair .  If this KeyPairGenerator has not been initialized explicitly ,  provider - specific defaults will be used for the size and other (algorithm - specific )  values of the generated keys .  This will generate a new key pair every time it is called .  This method is functionally equivalent to genKeyPair . 
Atomically decrements by one the current value . 
Gets the AccessibleSelection associated with this object if one exists .  Otherwise returns null . 
Removes a field from the descriptor . 
The constant indicating that a batch statement executed successfully but that no count of the number of rows it affected is available .

Creates a new permission with the specified name . 
Alignment character for cells in a column .  See the char attribute definition in HTML 4 . 0 . 
Constructs an instance of this class . 
Checks two DelegationPermission objects for equality . 
Acquires the write lock unless the current thread is interrupted .  Acquires the write lock if neither the read nor write lock are held by another thread and returns immediately ,  setting the write lock hold count to one .  If the current thread already holds this lock then the hold count is incremented by one and the method returns immediately .  If the lock is held by another thread then the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of two things happens: The write lock is acquired by the current thread; or Some other thread interrupts the current thread .  If the write lock is acquired by the current thread then the lock hold count is set to one .  If the current thread: has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or is interrupted while acquiring the write lock ,  then InterruptedException is thrown and the current thread's interrupted status is cleared .  In this implementation ,  as this method is an explicit interruption point ,  preference is given to responding to the interrupt over normal or reentrant acquisition of the lock . 
Returns the enum constant of this type with the specified name .  The string must match exactly an identifier used to declare an enum constant in this type .  (Extraneous whitespace characters are not permitted .  ) 
Returns an iterator object that iterates along the Shape object's boundary and provides access to a flattened view of the outline of the Shape object's geometry .  Only SEG _ MOVETO ,  SEG _ LINETO ,  and SEG _ CLOSE point types will be returned by the iterator .  The amount of subdivision of the curved segments is controlled by the flatness parameter ,  which specifies the maximum distance that any point on the unflattened transformed curve can deviate from the returned flattened path segments .  An optional AffineTransform can be specified so that the coordinates returned in the iteration are transformed accordingly . 
Handles the method MBeanServerConnection . getDomains ( ) . 
Returns the number of characters (valid indicies ) 
Return true if the line is all right - to - left text ,  and the base direction is right - to - left . 
Returns the length of the array . 
"Flushes queued data from the line .  The flushed data is discarded .  In some cases ,  not all queued data can be discarded .  For example ,  a mixer can flush data from the buffer for a specific input line ,  but any unplayed data already in the output buffer (the result of the mix )  will still be played .  You can invoke this method after pausing a line (the normal case )  if you want to skip the ""stale"" data when you restart playback or capture .  (It is legal to flush a line that is not stopped ,  but doing so on an active line is likely to cause a discontinuity in the data ,  resulting in a perceptible click .  ) "
Opens the line with the specified format ,  causing the line to acquire any required system resources and become operational .  The implementation chooses a buffer size ,  which is measured in bytes but which encompasses an integral number of sample frames .  The buffer size that the system has chosen may be queried by subsequently calling DataLine . getBufferSize ( ) .  If this operation succeeds ,  the line is marked as open ,  and an OPEN event is dispatched to the line's listeners .  Invoking this method on a line which is already open is illegal and may result in an IllegalStateException .  Note that some lines ,  once closed ,  cannot be reopened .  Attempts to reopen such a line will always result in a LineUnavailableException . 
Updates the designated column with a java . sql . Clob value .  The updater methods are used to update column values in the current row or the insert row .  The updater methods do not update the underlying database; instead the updateRow or insertRow methods are called to update the database . 
Invokes the getMinimumSize method on each UI handled by this object . 
Returns true if the iteration has more elements .  (In other words ,  returns true if Iterator . next( )  would return an element rather than throwing an exception .  ) 
Checks if this date is equal to the specified date ignoring the chronology .  This method differs from the comparison in compareTo ( java . time . chrono . ChronoLocalDate) in that it only compares the underlying date and not the chronology .  This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based on the time - line position .  This is equivalent to using date1 . toEpochDay ( ) == date2 . toEpochDay ( ) .  This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch - day . 
Returns the string table for class PresentationDirection . 
Sets a file's POSIX permissions .  The path parameter is associated with a FileSystem that supports the PosixFileAttributeView .  This attribute view provides access to file attributes commonly associated with files on file systems used by operating systems that implement the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX )  family of standards . 
Sets the property showDeleted to the given boolean value ,  which determines whether rows marked for deletion appear in the set of current rows . 
returns the first value from the List of String values for the given key (if at least one exists ) .
Get the right part of the margin around the view . 
Remove an attribute from the list .  SAX application writers can use this method to filter an attribute out of an AttributeList .  Note that invoking this method will change the length of the attribute list and some of the attribute's indices .  If the requested attribute is not in the list ,  this is a no - op . 
The value of this flag determines whether the children of entity reference nodes are visible to the NodeIterator .  If false ,  these children and their descendants will be rejected .  Note that this rejection takes precedence over whatToShow and the filter .  Also note that this is currently the only situation where NodeIterators may reject a complete subtree rather than skipping individual nodes .  To produce a view of the document that has entity references expanded and does not expose the entity reference node itself ,  use the whatToShow flags to hide the entity reference node and set expandEntityReferences to true when creating the NodeIterator .  To produce a view of the document that has entity reference nodes but no entity expansion ,  use the whatToShow flags to show the entity reference node and set expandEntityReferences to false . 
Returns a CollationElementIterator for the given String . 
Returns the service principal this KeyTab object is bound to .  Returns null if it's not bound .  Please note the deprecated constructors create a KeyTab object bound for some unknown principal .  In this case ,  this method also returns null .  User can call isBound ( ) to verify this case . 
Executes the given tasks, returning the result of one that has completed successfully (i . e . , without throwing an exception ) , if any do .  Upon normal or exceptional return, tasks that have not completed are cancelled .  The results of this method are undefined if the given collection is modified while this operation is in progress . 
Gets the keyboard mnemonic for the button . 
A resource variable . 
Deselects the columns from index0 to index1 ,  inclusive . 
Gives a hint as to the direction in which the rows in this ResultSet object will be processed .  The initial value is determined by the Statement object that produced this ResultSet object .  The fetch direction may be changed at any time .

Presents the parameter types as a list (a convenience method ) . The list will be immutable.
Returns an array indicating ,  for each notification this MBean may send ,  the name of the Java class of the notification and the notification type .  It is not illegal for the MBean to send notifications not described in this array .  However ,  some clients of the MBean server may depend on the array being complete for their correct functioning . 
"Returns the certificate ( s )  that were sent to the server during handshaking .  Note: This method is useful only when using certificate - based cipher suites .  When multiple certificates are available for use in a handshake ,  the implementation chooses what it considers the ""best"" certificate chain available ,  and transmits that to the other side .  This method allows the caller to know which certificate chain was actually sent . "
Transmits a control command to the terminal device .  This can be used to ,  for example ,  control terminal functions like a built - in PIN pad or biometrics . 
Invalidates the layout ,  indicating that if the layout manager has cached information it should be discarded . 
Returns true if it is a general entity . 
Get value of the SO _ SNDBUF option for this DatagramSocket ,  that is the buffer size used by the platform for output on this DatagramSocket . 
Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount subtracted .  This adjusts this temporal ,  subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount .  The amount is typically a Period but may be any other type implementing the TemporalAmount interface ,  such as Duration .  Some example code indicating how and why this method is used: date = date . minus ( period ) ; // subtract a Period instance date = date . minus ( duration ) ; // subtract a Duration instance date = date . minus ( workingDays ( 6 )  ) ; // example user - written workingDays method Note that calling plus followed by minus is not guaranteed to return the same date - time . 
Set the particular property in the underlying implementation of Marshaller .  This method can only be used to set one of the standard JAXB defined properties above or a provider specific property .  Attempting to set an undefined property will result in a PropertyException being thrown .  See Supported Properties . 
"Returns the double value corresponding to a given bit representation .  The argument is considered to be a representation of a floating-point value according to the IEEE 754 floating-point ""double format"" bit layout .  If the argument is 0x7ff0000000000000L ,  the result is positive infinity .  If the argument is 0xfff0000000000000L ,  the result is negative infinity .  If the argument is any value in the range 0x7ff0000000000001L through 0x7fffffffffffffffL or in the range 0xfff0000000000001L through 0xffffffffffffffffL ,  the result is a NaN .  No IEEE 754 floating-point operation provided by Java can distinguish between two NaN values of the same type with different bit patterns .  Distinct values of NaN are only distinguishable by use of the Double . doubleToRawLongBits method .  In all other cases ,  let s ,  e ,  and m be three values that can be computed from the argument: int s = ((bits >> 63 )  == 0 )  ? 1 : -1; int e = (int ) ((bits >> 52 )  & 0x7ffL ) ; long m = (e == 0 )  ? (bits & 0xfffffffffffffL )  << 1 : (bits & 0xfffffffffffffL )  | 0x10000000000000L; Then the floating-point result equals the value of the mathematical expression sÂ·mÂ·2e-1075 .  Note that this method may not be able to return a double NaN with exactly same bit pattern as the long argument .  IEEE 754 distinguishes between two kinds of NaNs ,  quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs .  The differences between the two kinds of NaN are generally not visible in Java .  Arithmetic operations on signaling NaNs turn them into quiet NaNs with a different ,  but often similar ,  bit pattern .  However ,  on some processors merely copying a signaling NaN also performs that conversion .  In particular ,  copying a signaling NaN to return it to the calling method may perform this conversion .  So longBitsToDouble may not be able to return a double with a signaling NaN bit pattern .  Consequently ,  for some long values ,  doubleToRawLongBits(longBitsToDouble(start )  )  may not equal start .  Moreover ,  which particular bit patterns represent signaling NaNs is platform dependent; although all NaN bit patterns ,  quiet or signaling ,  must be in the NaN range identified above . "
Adds the specified rows (inclusive )  to the selection. If the specified indices are within the viewable set of rows ,  or bound the viewable set of rows ,  then the specified indices are constrained by the viewable set of rows. If the indices are not within the viewable set of rows ,  or do not bound the viewable set of rows ,  then the selection is unchanged. For example ,  if the row count is 10 ,  and this method is invoked with -1 ,  20 ,  then the specified indices bounds the viewable range ,  and this is treated as if invoked with 0 ,  9. On the other hand ,  if this were invoked with -10 ,  -1 ,  then the specified indices do not bound the viewable set of rows ,  and the selection is unchanged. The parameters are not order dependent. That is ,  addSelectionInterval(x ,  y )  is equivalent to addSelectionInterval(y ,  x ) .

Constructs a new instance of NameAlreadyBoundException .  All fields are set to null;
Tests if the interior of the Shape entirely contains the specified Rectangle2D .  The Shape . contains ( ) method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return false when: the intersect method returns true and the calculations to determine whether or not the Shape entirely contains the Rectangle2D are prohibitively expensive .  This means that for some Shapes this method might return false even though the Shape contains the Rectangle2D .  The Area class performs more accurate geometric computations than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required . 
Returns an Accessible representing the specified selected child of the object .  If there isn't a selection ,  or there are fewer children selected than the integer passed in ,  the return value will be null .  Note that the index represents the i - th selected child ,  which is different from the i - th child .

Connects the socket to a remote address for this socket .  When a socket is connected to a remote address ,  packets may only be sent to or received from that address .  By default a datagram socket is not connected .  If the remote destination to which the socket is connected does not exist ,  or is otherwise unreachable ,  and if an ICMP destination unreachable packet has been received for that address ,  then a subsequent call to send or receive may throw a PortUnreachableException .  Note ,  there is no guarantee that the exception will be thrown .  If a security manager has been installed then it is invoked to check access to the remote address .  Specifically ,  if the given address is a multicast address ,  the security manager's checkMulticast method is invoked with the given address .  Otherwise ,  the security manager's checkConnect and checkAccept methods are invoked ,  with the given address and port ,  to verify that datagrams are permitted to be sent and received respectively .  When a socket is connected ,  receive and send will not perform any security checks on incoming and outgoing packets ,  other than matching the packet's and the socket's address and port .  On a send operation ,  if the packet's address is set and the packet's address and the socket's address do not match ,  an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown .  A socket connected to a multicast address may only be used to send packets .

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period subtracted .  This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period subtracted .  For example ,  on a LocalDate ,  this could be used to subtract a number of years ,  months or days .  The returned object will have the same observable type as this object .  In some cases ,  changing a field is not fully defined .  For example ,  if the target object is a date representing the 31st March ,  then subtracting one month would be unclear .  In cases like this ,  the field is responsible for resolving the result .  Typically it will choose the previous valid date ,  which would be the last valid day of February in this example .

"Instantiate a bean. The bean is created based on a name relative to a class - loader. This name should be a dot - separated name such as ""a.b.c"". In Beans 1.0 the given name can indicate either a serialized object or a class. Other mechanisms may be added in the future. In beans 1.0 we first try to treat the beanName as a serialized object name then as a class name. When using the beanName as a serialized object name we convert the given beanName to a resource pathname and add a trailing "".ser"" suffix. We then try to load a serialized object from that resource. For example ,  given a beanName of ""x.y"" ,  Beans.instantiate would first try to read a serialized object from the resource ""x/y.ser"" and if that failed it would try to load the class ""x.y"" and create an instance of that class. If the bean is a subtype of java.applet.Applet ,  then it is given some special initialization. First ,  it is supplied with a default AppletStub and AppletContext. Second ,  if it was instantiated from a classname the applet's ""init"" method is called. (If the bean was deserialized this step is skipped. )  Note that for beans which are applets ,  it is the caller's responsiblity to call ""start"" on the applet. For correct behaviour ,  this should be done after the applet has been added into a visible AWT container. Note that applets created via beans.instantiate run in a slightly different environment than applets running inside browsers. In particular ,  bean applets have no access to ""parameters"" ,  so they may wish to provide property get/set methods to set parameter values. We advise bean - applet developers to test their bean - applets against both the JDK appletviewer (for a reference browser environment )  and the BDK BeanBox (for a reference bean container ) ."

Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer .  This method initiates an asynchronous read operation to read a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer .  The method behaves in exactly the same manner as the read ( ByteBuffer , Object , CompletionHandler )  method except that instead of specifying a completion handler ,  this method returns a Future representing the pending result .  The Future's get method returns the number of bytes read or -1 if no bytes could be read because the channel has reached end-of-stream . 
The MediaType instance for ISO/DIN B9 ,  44 x 62 mm . 
Returns an Iterator over all the immediate child Nodes of this element .  This includes javax . xml . soap . Text objects as well as SOAPElement objects .  Calling this method may cause child Element ,  SOAPElement and org . w3c . dom . Text nodes to be replaced by SOAPElement ,  SOAPHeaderElement ,  SOAPBodyElement or javax . xml . soap . Text nodes as appropriate for the type of this parent node .  As a result the calling application must treat any existing references to these child nodes that have been obtained through DOM APIs as invalid and either discard them or refresh them with the values returned by this Iterator .  This behavior can be avoided by calling the equivalent DOM APIs .  See javax . xml . soap for more details .

Constructs a new JMenu with no text . 
Decodes as many bytes as possible from the given input buffer ,  writing the results to the given output buffer .  The buffers are read from ,  and written to ,  starting at their current positions .  At most in . remaining( )  bytes will be read and at most out . remaining( )  characters will be written .  The buffers' positions will be advanced to reflect the bytes read and the characters written ,  but their marks and limits will not be modified .  In addition to reading bytes from the input buffer and writing characters to the output buffer ,  this method returns a CoderResult object to describe its reason for termination: CoderResult . UNDERFLOW indicates that as much of the input buffer as possible has been decoded .  If there is no further input then the invoker can proceed to the next step of the decoding operation .  Otherwise this method should be invoked again with further input .  CoderResult . OVERFLOW indicates that there is insufficient space in the output buffer to decode any more bytes .  This method should be invoked again with an output buffer that has more remaining characters .  This is typically done by draining any decoded characters from the output buffer .  A malformed - input result indicates that a malformed - input error has been detected .  The malformed bytes begin at the input buffer's (possibly incremented )  position; the number of malformed bytes may be determined by invoking the result object's length method .  This case applies only if the malformed action of this decoder is CodingErrorAction . REPORT; otherwise the malformed input will be ignored or replaced ,  as requested .  An unmappable - character result indicates that an unmappable - character error has been detected .  The bytes that decode the unmappable character begin at the input buffer's (possibly incremented )  position; the number of such bytes may be determined by invoking the result object's length method .  This case applies only if the unmappable action of this decoder is CodingErrorAction . REPORT; otherwise the unmappable character will be ignored or replaced ,  as requested .  In any case ,  if this method is to be reinvoked in the same decoding operation then care should be taken to preserve any bytes remaining in the input buffer so that they are available to the next invocation .  The endOfInput parameter advises this method as to whether the invoker can provide further input beyond that contained in the given input buffer .  If there is a possibility of providing additional input then the invoker should pass false for this parameter; if there is no possibility of providing further input then the invoker should pass true .  It is not erroneous ,  and in fact it is quite common ,  to pass false in one invocation and later discover that no further input was actually available .  It is critical ,  however ,  that the final invocation of this method in a sequence of invocations always pass true so that any remaining undecoded input will be treated as being malformed .  This method works by invoking the decodeLoop method ,  interpreting its results ,  handling error conditions ,  and reinvoking it as necessary . 
Compares this descriptor to the given object .  The objects are equal if the given object is also a Descriptor ,  and if the two Descriptors have the same field names (possibly differing in case )  and the same associated values .  The respective values for a field in the two Descriptors are equal if the following conditions hold: If one value is null then the other must be too .  If one value is a primitive array then the other must be a primitive array of the same type with the same elements .  If one value is an object array then the other must be too and Arrays . deepEquals(Object [ ] , Object [ ] )  must return true .  Otherwise Object . equals(Object )  must return true .

Writes content from a document to the given stream in a format appropriate for this kind of content handler .  Since actual text editing is unicode based ,  this would generally be the preferred way to write the data .  Some types of content are stored in an 8 - bit form however ,  and will favor the OutputStream . 
Returns a file attribute view of a given type. A file attribute view provides a read - only or updatable view of a set of file attributes. This method is intended to be used where the file attribute view defines type - safe methods to read or update the file attributes. The type parameter is the type of the attribute view required and the method returns an instance of that type if supported. The BasicFileAttributeView type supports access to the basic attributes of a file. Invoking this method to select a file attribute view of that type will always return an instance of that class. The options array may be used to indicate how symbolic links are handled by the resulting file attribute view for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default ,  symbolic links are followed. If the option NOFOLLOW _ LINKS is present then symbolic links are not followed. This option is ignored by implementations that do not support symbolic links. Usage Example: Suppose we want read or set a file's ACL ,  if supported: Path path = ... AclFileAttributeView view = Files.getFileAttributeView(path ,  AclFileAttributeView.class ) ; if (view != null )  { List < AclEntry >  acl = view.getAcl( ) ; : }

"Returns a List of Locales as candidate locales for baseName and locale .  This method is called by the ResourceBundle . getBundle factory method each time the factory method tries finding a resource bundle for a target Locale .  The sequence of the candidate locales also corresponds to the runtime resource lookup path (also known as the parent chain ) , if the corresponding resource bundles for the candidate locales exist and their parents are not defined by loaded resource bundles themselves .  The last element of the list must be a root locale if it is desired to have the base bundle as the terminal of the parent chain .  If the given locale is equal to Locale . ROOT (the root locale ) , a List containing only the root Locale must be returned .  In this case, the ResourceBundle . getBundle factory method loads only the base bundle as the resulting resource bundle .  It is not a requirement to return an immutable (unmodifiable )  List .  However, the returned List must not be mutated after it has been returned by getCandidateLocales .  The default implementation returns a List containing Locales using the rules described below .  In the description below, L, S, C and V respectively represent non-empty language, script, country, and variant .  For example, [L, C] represents a Locale that has non-empty values only for language and country .  The form L(""xx"" )  represents the (non-empty )  language value is ""xx"" .  For all cases, Locales whose final component values are empty strings are omitted .  For an input Locale with an empty script value, append candidate Locales by omitting the final component one by one as below: [L, C, V] [L, C] [L] Locale . ROOT For an input Locale with a non-empty script value, append candidate Locales by omitting the final component up to language, then append candidates generated from the Locale with country and variant restored: [L, S, C, V] [L, S, C] [L, S] [L, C, V] [L, C] [L] Locale . ROOT For an input Locale with a variant value consisting of multiple subtags separated by underscore, generate candidate Locales by omitting the variant subtags one by one, then insert them after every occurrence of Locales with the full variant value in the original list .  For example, if the the variant consists of two subtags V1 and V2: [L, S, C, V1, V2] [L, S, C, V1] [L, S, C] [L, S] [L, C, V1, V2] [L, C, V1] [L, C] [L] Locale . ROOT Special cases for Chinese .  When an input Locale has the language ""zh"" (Chinese )  and an empty script value, either ""Hans"" (Simplified )  or ""Hant"" (Traditional )  might be supplied, depending on the country .  When the country is ""CN"" (China )  or ""SG"" (Singapore ) , ""Hans"" is supplied .  When the country is ""HK"" (Hong Kong SAR China ) , ""MO"" (Macau SAR China ) , or ""TW"" (Taiwan ) , ""Hant"" is supplied .  For all other countries or when the country is empty, no script is supplied .  For example, for Locale(""zh"", ""CN"" )  , the candidate list will be: [L(""zh"" ) , S(""Hans"" ) , C(""CN"" ) ] [L(""zh"" ) , S(""Hans"" ) ] [L(""zh"" ) , C(""CN"" ) ] [L(""zh"" ) ] Locale . ROOT For Locale(""zh"", ""TW"" ) , the candidate list will be: [L(""zh"" ) , S(""Hant"" ) , C(""TW"" ) ] [L(""zh"" ) , S(""Hant"" ) ] [L(""zh"" ) , C(""TW"" ) ] [L(""zh"" ) ] Locale . ROOT Special cases for Norwegian .  Both Locale(""no"", ""NO"", ""NY"" )  and Locale(""nn"", ""NO"" )  represent Norwegian Nynorsk .  When a locale's language is ""nn"", the standard candidate list is generated up to [L(""nn"" ) ], and then the following candidates are added: [L(""no"" ) , C(""NO"" ) , V(""NY"" ) ] [L(""no"" ) , C(""NO"" ) ] [L(""no"" ) ] Locale . ROOT If the locale is exactly Locale(""no"", ""NO"", ""NY"" ) , it is first converted to Locale(""nn"", ""NO"" )  and then the above procedure is followed .  Also, Java treats the language ""no"" as a synonym of Norwegian BokmÃ¥l ""nb"" .  Except for the single case Locale(""no"", ""NO"", ""NY"" )  (handled above ) , when an input Locale has language ""no"" or ""nb"", candidate Locales with language code ""no"" and ""nb"" are interleaved, first using the requested language, then using its synonym .  For example, Locale(""nb"", ""NO"", ""POSIX"" )  generates the following candidate list: [L(""nb"" ) , C(""NO"" ) , V(""POSIX"" ) ] [L(""no"" ) , C(""NO"" ) , V(""POSIX"" ) ] [L(""nb"" ) , C(""NO"" ) ] [L(""no"" ) , C(""NO"" ) ] [L(""nb"" ) ] [L(""no"" ) ] Locale . ROOT Locale(""no"", ""NO"", ""POSIX"" )  would generate the same list except that locales with ""no"" would appear before the corresponding locales with ""nb"" .  The default implementation uses an ArrayList that overriding implementations may modify before returning it to the caller .  However, a subclass must not modify it after it has been returned by getCandidateLocales .  For example, if the given baseName is ""Messages"" and the given locale is Locale(""ja"", """", ""XX"" ) , then a List of Locales: Locale(""ja"", """", ""XX"" )  Locale(""ja"" )  Locale . ROOT is returned .  And if the resource bundles for the ""ja"" and """" Locales are found, then the runtime resource lookup path (parent chain )  is: Messages _ ja - >  Messages"
Invoked when rows have been changed in the underlying model between the specified range (inclusive ) . You normally do not call this method. This method is public to allow view classes to call it.

Returns an Enumerator that increments over the visible paths starting at the passed in location .  The ordering of the enumeration is based on how the paths are displayed . 
Returns the DynAny for the component at the current position .  It does not advance the current position ,  so repeated calls to current _ component without an intervening call to rewind ,  next ,  or seek return the same component .  The returned DynAny object reference can be used to get/set the value of the current component .  If the current component represents a complex type ,  the returned reference can be narrowed based on the TypeCode to get the interface corresponding to the to the complex type .  Calling current _ component on a DynAny that cannot have components ,  such as a DynEnum or an empty exception ,  raises TypeMismatch .  Calling current _ component on a DynAny whose current position is -1 returns a nil reference .  The iteration operations ,  together with current _ component ,  can be used to dynamically compose an any value .  After creating a dynamic any ,  such as a DynStruct ,  current _ component and next can be used to initialize all the components of the value .  Once the dynamic value is completely initialized ,  to _ any creates the corresponding any value .

Constructs a WindowEvent object with the specified previous and new window states .  This method throws an IllegalArgumentException if source is null . 
"Adds a node using its nodeName attribute .  If a node with that name is already present in this map ,  it is replaced by the new one .  Replacing a node by itself has no effect .  As the nodeName attribute is used to derive the name which the node must be stored under ,  multiple nodes of certain types (those that have a ""special"" string value )  cannot be stored as the names would clash .  This is seen as preferable to allowing nodes to be aliased . "
Checks that the certificate is currently valid .  It is if the current date and time are within the validity period given in the certificate .  The validity period consists of two date/time values: the first and last dates (and times )  on which the certificate is valid .

Returns the DynAny for the component at the current position .  It does not advance the current position ,  so repeated calls to current _ component without an intervening call to rewind ,  next ,  or seek return the same component .  The returned DynAny object reference can be used to get/set the value of the current component .  If the current component represents a complex type ,  the returned reference can be narrowed based on the TypeCode to get the interface corresponding to the to the complex type .  Calling current _ component on a DynAny that cannot have components ,  such as a DynEnum or an empty exception ,  raises TypeMismatch .  Calling current _ component on a DynAny whose current position is -1 returns a nil reference .  The iteration operations ,  together with current _ component ,  can be used to dynamically compose an any value .  After creating a dynamic any ,  such as a DynStruct ,  current _ component and next can be used to initialize all the components of the value .  Once the dynamic value is completely initialized ,  to _ any creates the corresponding any value . 
Appends the specified character sequence to this writer .  An invocation of this method of the form out . append ( csq) behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation out . write ( csq . toString ( )) Depending on the specification of toString for the character sequence csq ,  the entire sequence may not be appended .  For instance ,  invoking the toString method of a character buffer will return a subsequence whose content depends upon the buffer's position and limit .

Returns an enum indicating how the baseline of the border changes as the size changes . 
Returns a data element array representation of a pixel in this ColorModel ,  given an integer pixel representation in the default RGB color model .  This array can then be passed to the setDataElements method of a WritableRaster object .  If the pixel variable is null ,  a new array is allocated .  If pixel is not null ,  it must be a primitive array of type transferType; otherwise ,  a ClassCastException is thrown .  An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown if pixel is not large enough to hold a pixel value for this ColorModel .  The pixel array is returned .  Since DirectColorModel can be subclassed ,  subclasses inherit the implementation of this method and if they don't override it then they throw an exception if they use an unsupported transferType . 
Gets the range that the field is bound by .  The range of the field is the period that the field varies within .  For example ,  in the field 'MonthOfYear' ,  the range is 'Years' .  See also getBaseUnit ( ) .  The range is never null .  For example ,  the 'Year' field is shorthand for 'YearOfForever' .  It therefore has a unit of 'Years' and a range of 'Forever' .

Returns the digest length in bytes .  This concrete method has been added to this previously - defined abstract class .  (For backwards compatibility ,  it cannot be abstract .  )  The default behavior is to return 0 .  This method may be overridden by a provider to return the digest length . 
Insert the result of the parse operation as the immediately following sibling of the context node .  For this action to work the context node's parent must be an Element or a DocumentFragment . 
Returns the number of accessible children in the object .  If all of the children of this object implement Accessible ,  this method should return the number of children of this object .  UIs might wish to override this if they present areas on the screen that can be viewed as components ,  but actual components are not used for presenting those areas .  Note: As of v1 . 3 ,  it is recommended that developers call Component . AccessibleAWTComponent . getAccessibleChildrenCount ( ) instead of this method .

"Returns a string representation of the object .  In general ,  the toString method returns a string that ""textually represents"" this object .  The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read .  It is recommended that all subclasses override this method .  The toString method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance ,  the at - sign character `@' ,  and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object .  In other words ,  this method returns a string equal to the value of: getClass ( ) . getName ( ) + '@' + Integer . toHexString ( hashCode ( ))"

Returns an array of all the objects currently registered as FooListeners upon this caret .  FooListeners are registered using the addFooListener method .  You can specify the listenerType argument with a class literal ,  such as FooListener . class .  For example ,  you can query a DefaultCaret c for its change listeners with the following code: ChangeListener [ ] cls = (ChangeListener [ ] ) (c . getListeners(ChangeListener . class )  ) ; If no such listeners exist ,  this method returns an empty array . 
"Returns a list of mechanisms that support the indicated name type .  The Kerberos v5 mechanism (""1 . 2 . 840 . 113554 . 1 . 2 . 2"" )  will always be returned in this list when the indicated nametype is one of GSSName . NT _ HOSTBASED _ SERVICE ,  GSSName .

Moves this component to a new location .  The top - left corner of the new location is specified by the x and y parameters in the coordinate space of this component's parent .  This method changes layout - related information ,  and therefore ,  invalidates the component hierarchy .  The method changes the geometry - related data .  Therefore ,  the native windowing system may ignore such requests ,  or it may modify the requested data ,  so that the Window object is placed and sized in a way that corresponds closely to the desktop settings . 
Creates a new scrolling list initialized to display the specified number of rows .  Note that if zero rows are specified ,  then the list will be created with a default of four rows .  Also note that the number of visible rows in the list cannot be changed after it has been created .  If the value of multipleMode is true ,  then the user can select multiple items from the list .  If it is false ,  only one item at a time can be selected .

Creates an uninitialized text storage model (PlainDocument )  that is appropriate for this type of editor . 
Invokes the paint method on each UI handled by this object . 
"Declare a Namespace prefix .  All prefixes must be declared before they are referenced .  For example ,  a SAX driver (parser )  would scan an element's attributes in two passes: first for namespace declarations ,  then a second pass using processName( )  to interpret prefixes against (potentially redefined )  prefixes .  This method declares a prefix in the current Namespace context; the prefix will remain in force until this context is popped ,  unless it is shadowed in a descendant context .  To declare the default element Namespace ,  use the empty string as the prefix .  Note that there is an asymmetry in this library: getPrefix will not return the """" prefix ,  even if you have declared a default element namespace .  To check for a default namespace ,  you have to look it up explicitly using getURI .  This asymmetry exists to make it easier to look up prefixes for attribute names ,  where the default prefix is not allowed . "
Recursively search through the border hierarchy (if it exists )  for a TitledBorder with a non - null title .  This does a depth first search on first the inside borders then the outside borders .  The assumption is that titles make really pretty inside borders but not very pretty outside borders in compound border situations .  It's rather arbitrary ,  but hopefully decent UI programmers will not create multiple titled borders for the same component . 
Get the rendering context of the Font within this Graphics2D context .  The FontRenderContext encapsulates application hints such as anti - aliasing and fractional metrics ,  as well as target device specific information such as dots - per - inch .  This information should be provided by the application when using objects that perform typographical formatting ,  such as Font and TextLayout .  This information should also be provided by applications that perform their own layout and need accurate measurements of various characteristics of glyphs such as advance and line height when various rendering hints have been applied to the text rendering . 
Moves the cursor to the previous row in this ResultSet object .  When a call to the previous method returns false ,  the cursor is positioned before the first row .  Any invocation of a ResultSet method which requires a current row will result in a SQLException being thrown .  If an input stream is open for the current row ,  a call to the method previous will implicitly close it .  A ResultSet object's warning change is cleared when a new row is read . 
Constructs a new throwable with the specified detail message and cause .  Note that the detail message associated with cause is not automatically incorporated in this throwable's detail message .  The fillInStackTrace ( ) method is called to initialize the stack trace data in the newly created throwable .

"An attribute specifying ,  as part of the XML declaration ,  the version number of this document. If there is no declaration and if this document supports the ""XML"" feature ,  the value is ""1.0"". If this document does not support the ""XML"" feature ,  the value is always null. Changing this attribute will affect methods that check for invalid characters in XML names. Application should invoke Document.normalizeDocument( )  in order to check for invalid characters in the Nodes that are already part of this Document. DOM applications may use the DOMImplementation.hasFeature(feature ,  version )  method with parameter values ""XMLVersion"" and ""1.0"" (respectively )  to determine if an implementation supports [XML 1.0 ] . DOM applications may use the same method with parameter values ""XMLVersion"" and ""1.1"" (respectively )  to determine if an implementation supports [XML 1.1 ] . In both cases ,  in order to support XML ,  an implementation must also support the ""XML"" feature defined in this specification. Document objects supporting a version of the ""XMLVersion"" feature must not raise a NOT _ SUPPORTED _ ERR exception for the same version number when using Document.xmlVersion."

Sets the ContentHandler which receives the augmented validation result .  When a ContentHandler is specified ,  a ValidatorHandler will work as a filter and basically copy the incoming events to the specified ContentHandler .  In doing so ,  a ValidatorHandler may modify the events ,  for example by adding defaulted attributes .  A ValidatorHandler may buffer events to certain extent ,  but to allow ValidatorHandler to be used by a parser ,  the following requirement has to be met .  When ContentHandler . startElement ( String ,  String ,  String ,  Attributes) ,  ContentHandler . endElement ( String ,  String ,  String) ,  ContentHandler . startDocument ( ) ,  or ContentHandler . endDocument ( ) are invoked on a ValidatorHandler ,  the same method on the user - specified ContentHandler must be invoked for the same event before the callback returns .  ValidatorHandler may not introduce new elements that were not present in the input .  ValidatorHandler may not remove attributes that were present in the input .  When a callback method on the specified ContentHandler throws an exception ,  the same exception object must be thrown from the ValidatorHandler .

Paints the border of the content area of a tool bar .  This implementation invokes the method of the same name without the orientation . 
"Rename an existing node of type ELEMENT _ NODE or ATTRIBUTE _ NODE .  When possible this simply changes the name of the given node ,  otherwise this creates a new node with the specified name and replaces the existing node with the new node as described below .  If simply changing the name of the given node is not possible ,  the following operations are performed: a new node is created ,  any registered event listener is registered on the new node ,  any user data attached to the old node is removed from that node ,  the old node is removed from its parent if it has one ,  the children are moved to the new node ,  if the renamed node is an Element its attributes are moved to the new node ,  the new node is inserted at the position the old node used to have in its parent's child nodes list if it has one ,  the user data that was attached to the old node is attached to the new node .  When the node being renamed is an Element only the specified attributes are moved ,  default attributes originated from the DTD are updated according to the new element name .  In addition ,  the implementation may update default attributes from other schemas .  Applications should use Document . normalizeDocument ( ) to guarantee these attributes are up - to - date .  When the node being renamed is an Attr that is attached to an Element ,  the node is first removed from the Element attributes map .  Then ,  once renamed ,  either by modifying the existing node or creating a new one as described above ,  it is put back .  In addition ,  a user data event NODE _ RENAMED is fired ,  when the implementation supports the feature ""MutationNameEvents"" ,  each mutation operation involved in this method fires the appropriate event ,  and in the end the event { http://www . w3 . org/2001/xml - events ,  DOMElementNameChanged} or { http://www . w3 . org/2001/xml - events ,  DOMAttributeNameChanged} is fired .

Returns a list containing a Location object for each executable source line in this reference type. Each location maps a source line to a range of code indices. The beginning of the range can be determined through Location.codeIndex( ) . The returned list may contain multiple locations for a particular line number, if the compiler and/or VM has mapped that line to two or more disjoint code index ranges. Note that it is possible for the same source line to represent different code index ranges in different methods. For arrays (ArrayType )  and primitive classes, the returned list is always empty. For interfaces (InterfaceType ) , the returned list will be non - empty only if the interface has executable code in its class initialization. Returned list is for the specified stratum (see Location for a description of strata ) .

"Creates an instance of an object for the specified object and environment. If an object factory builder has been installed, it is used to create a factory for creating the object. Otherwise, the following rules are used to create the object: If refInfo is a Reference or Referenceable containing a factory class name, use the named factory to create the object. Return refInfo if the factory cannot be created. Under JDK 1.1, if the factory class must be loaded from a location specified in the reference, a SecurityManager must have been installed or the factory creation will fail. If an exception is encountered while creating the factory, it is passed up to the caller. If refInfo is a Reference or Referenceable with no factory class name, and the address or addresses are StringRefAddrs with address type ""URL"", try the URL context factory corresponding to each URL's scheme id to create the object (see getURLContext( )  ) . If that fails, continue to the next step. Use the object factories specified in the Context.OBJECT _ FACTORIES property of the environment, and of the provider resource file associated with nameCtx, in that order. The value of this property is a colon-separated list of factory class names that are tried in order, and the first one that succeeds in creating an object is the one used. If none of the factories can be loaded, return refInfo. If an exception is encountered while creating the object, the exception is passed up to the caller. Service providers that implement the DirContext interface should use DirectoryManager.getObjectInstance( ) , not this method. Service providers that implement only the Context interface should use this method. Note that an object factory (an object that implements the ObjectFactory interface )  must be public and must have a public constructor that accepts no arguments. The name and nameCtx parameters may optionally be used to specify the name of the object being created. name is the name of the object, relative to context nameCtx. This information could be useful to the object factory or to the object implementation. If there are several possible contexts from which the object could be named -- as will often be the case -- it is up to the caller to select one. A good rule of thumb is to select the ""deepest"" context available. If nameCtx is null, name is relative to the default initial context. If no name is being specified, the name parameter should be null."
Constructs a new ProtocolException with the specified detail message . 
Returns a String representation of the Object value based on the mask .  Refer to setValueContainsLiteralCharacters ( boolean )  for details on how literals are treated . 
Gets the date/time formatter with the given formatting styles for the given locale . 
Allow an application to register a validation event handler .  The validation event handler will be called by the JAXB Provider if any validation errors are encountered during calls to any of the marshal API's .  If the client application does not register a validation event handler before invoking one of the marshal methods ,  then validation events will be handled by the default event handler which will terminate the marshal operation after the first error or fatal error is encountered .  Calling this method with a null parameter will cause the Marshaller to revert back to the default default event handler .

Returns the address of the endpoint this socket is bound to .  If a socket bound to an endpoint represented by an InetSocketAddress is closed ,  then this method will continue to return an InetSocketAddress after the socket is closed .  In that case the returned InetSocketAddress's address is the wildcard address and its port is the local port that it was bound to .  If there is a security manager set ,  its checkConnect method is called with the local address and -1 as its arguments to see if the operation is allowed .  If the operation is not allowed ,  a SocketAddress representing the loopback address and the local port to which this socket is bound is returned . 
Determines if the specified Object is assignment - compatible with the object represented by this Class .  This method is the dynamic equivalent of the Java language instanceof operator .  The method returns true if the specified Object argument is non - null and can be cast to the reference type represented by this Class object without raising a ClassCastException .  It returns false otherwise .  Specifically ,  if this Class object represents a declared class ,  this method returns true if the specified Object argument is an instance of the represented class (or of any of its subclasses ) ; it returns false otherwise .  If this Class object represents an array class ,  this method returns true if the specified Object argument can be converted to an object of the array class by an identity conversion or by a widening reference conversion; it returns false otherwise .  If this Class object represents an interface ,  this method returns true if the class or any superclass of the specified Object argument implements this interface; it returns false otherwise .  If this Class object represents a primitive type ,  this method returns false . 
Creates a new phaser with the given parent and number of registered unarrived parties .  When the given parent is non - null and the given number of parties is greater than zero ,  this child phaser is registered with its parent . 
An alias for PERSONAL _ ENVELOPE . 
Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into a subsequence of the given buffers. This operation, sometimes called a scattering read, is often useful when implementing network protocols that group data into segments consisting of one or more fixed-length headers followed by a variable-length body. The handler parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the read operation completes (or fails ) . The result passed to the completion handler is the number of bytes read or -1 if no bytes could be read because the channel has reached end-of-stream. This method initiates a read of up to r bytes from this channel, where r is the total number of bytes remaining in the specified subsequence of the given buffer array, that is, dsts [ offset ] .remaining( )  + dsts [ offset+1 ] .remaining( )  + ... + dsts [ offset+length-1 ] .remaining( )  at the moment that the read is attempted. Suppose that a byte sequence of length n is read, where 0 < n <= r. Up to the first dsts [ offset ] .remaining( )  bytes of this sequence are transferred into buffer dsts [ offset ] , up to the next dsts [ offset+1 ] .remaining( )  bytes are transferred into buffer dsts [ offset+1 ] , and so forth, until the entire byte sequence is transferred into the given buffers. As many bytes as possible are transferred into each buffer, hence the final position of each updated buffer, except the last updated buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to that buffer's limit. The underlying operating system may impose a limit on the number of buffers that may be used in an I/O operation. Where the number of buffers (with bytes remaining ) , exceeds this limit, then the I/O operation is performed with the maximum number of buffers allowed by the operating system. If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation completes then it completes with the exception InterruptedByTimeoutException. Where a timeout occurs, and the implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been read, or will not be read from the channel into the given buffers, then further attempts to read from the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be thrown.

Joins a multicast group to begin receiving all datagrams sent to the group ,  returning a membership key .  If this channel is currently a member of the group on the given interface to receive all datagrams then the membership key ,  representing that membership ,  is returned .  Otherwise this channel joins the group and the resulting new membership key is returned .  The resulting membership key is not source - specific .  A multicast channel may join several multicast groups ,  including the same group on more than one interface .  An implementation may impose a limit on the number of groups that may be joined at the same time .

Unmarshal XML data from the specified XML Source and return the resulting content tree. Implements Unmarshal Global Root Element. SAX 2.0 Parser Pluggability A client application can choose not to use the default parser mechanism supplied with their JAXB provider. Any SAX 2.0 compliant parser can be substituted for the JAXB provider's default mechanism. To do so ,  the client application must properly configure a SAXSource containing an XMLReader implemented by the SAX 2.0 parser provider. If the XMLReader has an org.xml.sax.ErrorHandler registered on it ,  it will be replaced by the JAXB Provider so that validation errors can be reported via the ValidationEventHandler mechanism of JAXB. If the SAXSource does not contain an XMLReader ,  then the JAXB provider's default parser mechanism will be used. This parser replacement mechanism can also be used to replace the JAXB provider's unmarshal - time validation engine. The client application must properly configure their SAX 2.0 compliant parser to perform validation (as shown in the example above ) . Any SAXParserExceptions encountered by the parser during the unmarshal operation will be processed by the JAXB provider and converted into JAXB ValidationEvent objects which will be reported back to the client via the ValidationEventHandler registered with the Unmarshaller. Note: specifying a substitute validating SAX 2.0 parser for unmarshalling does not necessarily replace the validation engine used by the JAXB provider for performing on - demand validation. The only way for a client application to specify an alternate parser mechanism to be used during unmarshal is via the unmarshal(SAXSource )  API. All other forms of the unmarshal method (File ,  URL ,  Node ,  etc )  will use the JAXB provider's default parser and validator mechanisms.

Returns a new SimpleMeter with the ResourceType and allocating from a parent . 
"Create a new instance of the factory .  This static method creates a new factory instance .  This method uses the following ordered lookup procedure to determine the XMLInputFactory implementation class to load: Use the javax . xml . stream . XMLInputFactory system property .  Use the properties file ""lib/stax . properties"" in the JRE directory .  This configuration file is in standard java . util . Properties format and contains the fully qualified name of the implementation class with the key being the system property defined above .  Use the service - provider loading facilities ,  defined by the ServiceLoader class ,  to attempt to locate and load an implementation of the service using the default loading mechanism: the service - provider loading facility will use the current thread's context class loader to attempt to load the service .  If the context class loader is null ,  the system class loader will be used .  Otherwise ,  the system - default implementation is returned .  Once an application has obtained a reference to a XMLInputFactory it can use the factory to configure and obtain stream instances .  Note that this is a new method that replaces the deprecated newInstance ( ) method .  No changes in behavior are defined by this replacement method relative to the deprecated method . "
Identifies the next direction in a sequence . 
A method that result - bearing CountedCompleters may optionally use to help maintain result data .  By default ,  does nothing .  Overrides are not recommended .

For events relating to elements being analyzed for errors . 
Returns an array of all the listeners which have been associated with the named property . 
Gets the accessibleName property of this object .  The accessibleName property of an object is a localized String that designates the purpose of the object .  For example ,  the accessibleName property of a label or button might be the text of the label or button itself .  In the case of an object that doesn't display its name ,  the accessibleName should still be set .  For example ,  in the case of a text field used to enter the name of a city ,  the accessibleName for the en _ US locale could be 'city . '
Gets the lightWeightPopupEnabled property . 
Adds an element representing the preferred gap between two components . 
Redispatches an AWTEvent in such a way that the AWT event dispatcher will not recursively request that the KeyboardFocusManager ,  or any installed KeyEventDispatchers ,  dispatch the event again .  Client implementations of dispatchEvent and client - defined KeyEventDispatchers must call redispatchEvent ( target ,  e )  instead of target . dispatchEvent ( e )  to dispatch an event .  This method is intended to be used only by KeyboardFocusManagers and KeyEventDispatchers .  It is not for general client use . 
Invokes the contains method on each UI handled by this object . 
Repositions this audio input stream to the position it had at the time its mark method was last invoked .

The X coordinate of the second control point of the cubic curve segment . 
Returns the blue color component for the specified pixel ,  scaled from 0 to 255 in the default RGB ColorSpace ,  sRGB. A color conversion is done if necessary. The pixel value is specified by an array of data elements of type transferType passed in as an object reference. The returned value is a non pre - multiplied value. If the alpha is premultiplied ,  this method divides it out before returning the value (if the alpha value is 0 ,  the blue value will be 0 ) . Since ComponentColorModel can be subclassed ,  subclasses inherit the implementation of this method and if they don't override it then they throw an exception if they use an unsupported transferType.
Returns the detail message string of this throwable . 
Allows the MBean to perform any operations it needs before being registered in the MBean server. If the name of the MBean is not specified ,  the MBean can provide a name for its registration. If any exception is raised ,  the MBean will not be registered in the MBean server. The default implementation of this method returns the name parameter. It does nothing else for Standard MBeans. For MXBeans ,  it records the MBeanServer and ObjectName parameters so they can be used to translate inter - MXBean references. It is good practice for a subclass that overrides this method to call the overridden method via super.preRegister ( ... ) . This is necessary if this object is an MXBean that is referenced by attributes or operations in other MXBeans.
Returns a copy of all the certificates for this identity . 
Creates a new ComponentSampleModel with the specified width and height .  The new SampleModel will have the same number of bands ,  storage data type ,  interleaving scheme ,  and pixel stride as this SampleModel . 
Sets whether or not the tab at index is enabled .  An internal exception is raised if there is no tab at that index . 
"Report the beginning of some internal and external XML entities .  The reporting of parameter entities (including the external DTD subset )  is optional ,  and SAX2 drivers that report LexicalHandler events may not implement it; you can use the http://xml . org/sax/features/lexical - handler/parameter - entities feature to query or control the reporting of parameter entities .  General entities are reported with their regular names ,  parameter entities have '%' prepended to their names ,  and the external DTD subset has the pseudo - entity name "" [ dtd ] "" .  When a SAX2 driver is providing these events ,  all other events must be properly nested within start/end entity events .  There is no additional requirement that events from DeclHandler or DTDHandler be properly ordered .  Note that skipped entities will be reported through the skippedEntity event ,  which is part of the ContentHandler interface .  Because of the streaming event model that SAX uses ,  some entity boundaries cannot be reported under any circumstances: general entities within attribute values parameter entities within declarations These will be silently expanded ,  with no indication of where the original entity boundaries were .  Note also that the boundaries of character references (which are not really entities anyway )  are not reported .  All start/endEntity events must be properly nested . "
Returns the GC information related to the last garbage collection
Constructs an ActivateFailedException with the specified detail message . 
Moves the TreeWalker to the previous sibling of the current node ,  and returns the new node .  If the current node has no visible previous sibling ,  returns null ,  and retains the current node . 
Creates a Box that displays its components along the the specified axis . 
Returns a copy of this ZonedDateTime with the time truncated .  Truncation returns a copy of the original date - time with fields smaller than the specified unit set to zero .  For example ,  truncating with the minutes unit will set the second - of - minute and nano - of - second field to zero .  The unit must have a duration that divides into the length of a standard day without remainder .  This includes all supplied time units on ChronoUnit and DAYS .  Other units throw an exception .  This operates on the local time - line ,  truncating the underlying local date - time .  This is then converted back to a ZonedDateTime ,  using the zone ID to obtain the offset .  When converting back to ZonedDateTime ,  if the local date - time is in an overlap ,  then the offset will be retained if possible ,  otherwise the earlier offset will be used .  If in a gap ,  the local date - time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap .  This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call . 
The ISO date formatter that formats or parses the week - based date without an offset ,  such as '2012 - W48 - 6'. This returns an immutable formatter capable of formatting and parsing the ISO - 8601 extended week - based date format. The format consists of: Four digits or more for the week - based - year. Years in the range 0000 to 9999 will be pre - padded by zero to ensure four digits. Years outside that range will have a prefixed positive or negative symbol. A dash The letter 'W'. Parsing is case insensitive. Two digits for the week - of - week - based - year. This is pre - padded by zero to ensure three digits. A dash One digit for the day - of - week. The value run from Monday (1 )  to Sunday (7 ) . If the offset is not available to format or parse then the format is complete. The offset ID. If the offset has seconds then they will be handled even though this is not part of the ISO - 8601 standard. Parsing is case insensitive. As this formatter has an optional element ,  it may be necessary to parse using parseBest(java.lang.CharSequence ,  java.time.temporal.TemporalQuery < ? > ... ) . The returned formatter has a chronology of ISO set to ensure dates in other calendar systems are correctly converted. It has no override zone and uses the STRICT resolver style.
Returns the association that this notification is applicable to . 
Skips over and discards n bytes of data from the input stream. The skip method may ,  for a variety of reasons ,  end up skipping over some smaller number of bytes ,  possibly 0. The actual number of bytes skipped is returned. This method simply performs in.skip ( n ) .
Sets the property that indicates whether the approve and cancel buttons are shown in the file chooser .  This property is true by default .  Look and feels that always show these buttons will ignore the value of this property .  This method fires a property - changed event ,  using the string value of CONTROL _ BUTTONS _ ARE _ SHOWN _ CHANGED _ PROPERTY as the name of the property .

Get the value of a feature/property from the underlying implementation
"This method returns the MIME type of the data in the form of a string .  It should always return a valid type .  It is suggested that getContentType return ""application/octet - stream"" if the DataSource implementation can not determine the data type . "
Marshals to ostream the value in the value field of the Holder . 
Resolves parsed ChronoField values into a date during parsing .  Most TemporalField implementations are resolved using the resolve method on the field .  By contrast ,  the ChronoField class defines fields that only have meaning relative to the chronology .  As such ,  ChronoField date fields are resolved here in the context of a specific chronology .  ChronoField instances on the ISO calendar system are resolved as follows .  EPOCH _ DAY - If present ,  this is converted to a LocalDate and all other date fields are then cross-checked against the date .  PROLEPTIC _ MONTH - If present ,  then it is split into the YEAR and MONTH _ OF _ YEAR .  If the mode is strict or smart then the field is validated .  YEAR _ OF _ ERA and ERA - If both are present ,  then they are combined to form a YEAR .  In lenient mode ,  the YEAR _ OF _ ERA range is not validated ,  in smart and strict mode it is .  The ERA is validated for range in all three modes .  If only the YEAR _ OF _ ERA is present ,  and the mode is smart or lenient ,  then the current era (CE/AD )  is assumed .  In strict mode ,  no era is assumed and the YEAR _ OF _ ERA is left untouched .  If only the ERA is present ,  then it is left untouched .  YEAR ,  MONTH _ OF _ YEAR and DAY _ OF _ MONTH - If all three are present ,  then they are combined to form a LocalDate .  In all three modes ,  the YEAR is validated .  If the mode is smart or strict ,  then the month and day are validated ,  with the day validated from 1 to 31 .  If the mode is lenient ,  then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first of January in the requested year ,  then adding the difference in months ,  then the difference in days .  If the mode is smart ,  and the day-of-month is greater than the maximum for the year-month ,  then the day-of-month is adjusted to the last day-of-month .  If the mode is strict ,  then the three fields must form a valid date .  YEAR and DAY _ OF _ YEAR - If both are present ,  then they are combined to form a LocalDate .  In all three modes ,  the YEAR is validated .  If the mode is lenient ,  then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first of January in the requested year ,  then adding the difference in days .  If the mode is smart or strict ,  then the two fields must form a valid date .  YEAR ,  MONTH _ OF _ YEAR ,  ALIGNED _ WEEK _ OF _ MONTH and ALIGNED _ DAY _ OF _ WEEK _ IN _ MONTH - If all four are present ,  then they are combined to form a LocalDate .  In all three modes ,  the YEAR is validated .  If the mode is lenient ,  then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first of January in the requested year ,  then adding the difference in months ,  then the difference in weeks ,  then in days .  If the mode is smart or strict ,  then the all four fields are validated to their outer ranges .  The date is then combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first day of the requested year and month ,  then adding the amount in weeks and days to reach their values .  If the mode is strict ,  the date is additionally validated to check that the day and week adjustment did not change the month .  YEAR ,  MONTH _ OF _ YEAR ,  ALIGNED _ WEEK _ OF _ MONTH and DAY _ OF _ WEEK - If all four are present ,  then they are combined to form a LocalDate .  The approach is the same as described above for years ,  months and weeks in ALIGNED _ DAY _ OF _ WEEK _ IN _ MONTH .  The day-of-week is adjusted as the next or same matching day-of-week once the years ,  months and weeks have been handled .  YEAR ,  ALIGNED _ WEEK _ OF _ YEAR and ALIGNED _ DAY _ OF _ WEEK _ IN _ YEAR - If all three are present ,  then they are combined to form a LocalDate .  In all three modes ,  the YEAR is validated .

The approach is the same as described above for years and weeks in ALIGNED _ DAY _ OF _ WEEK _ IN _ YEAR .  The day-of-week is adjusted as the next or same matching day-of-week once the years and weeks have been handled . 
"Returns a string representation of the object .  In general ,  the toString method returns a string that ""textually represents"" this object .  The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read .  It is recommended that all subclasses override this method .  The toString method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance ,  the at - sign character `@' ,  and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object .  In other words ,  this method returns a string equal to the value of: getClass ( ) . getName ( ) + '@' + Integer . toHexString ( hashCode ( ))"

Gets the keyboard mnemonic for the button . 
Appends the specified element to the end of this list (optional operation ) . Lists that support this operation may place limitations on what elements may be added to this list. In particular, some lists will refuse to add null elements, and others will impose restrictions on the type of elements that may be added. List classes should clearly specify in their documentation any restrictions on what elements may be added. This implementation calls add(size( ) , e ) . Note that this implementation throws an UnsupportedOperationException unless add(int, E )  is overridden.
The tag ,  represented as a profile id . 
Gets the width of the arc that rounds off the corners . 
"Creates an ObjectInputStream that reads from the specified InputStream .  A serialization stream header is read from the stream and verified .

An alias for ISO _ A8 . 
Ease - of - use constant for getAlignmentX .  Specifies an alignment to the left side of the component . 
Constructs a key pair from the given public key and private key .  Note that this constructor only stores references to the public and private key components in the generated key pair .  This is safe ,  because Key objects are immutable . 
Retrieves the name of the signature algorithm . 
Requests that sequence checking be enabled for the per - message security services after context establishment .  This request can only be made on the context initiator's side and it has to be done prior to the first call to initSecContext .  During context establishment sequence checking is not an option and is a function of the underlying mechanism's capabilities .  Not all mechanisms support sequence checking and some mechanisms might require sequence checking even if the application doesn't .  Therefore ,  the application should check to see if the request was honored with the getSequenceDetState method .  If sequence checking is enabled then the MessageProp . isDuplicateToken ,  MessageProp . isOldToken ,  MessageProp . isUnseqToken ,  and MessageProp . isGapToken methods will return valid results for the MessageProp object that is passed in to the unwrap method or the verifyMIC method .

Returns the byte array that backs this buffer (optional operation ) . Modifications to this buffer's content will cause the returned array's content to be modified ,  and vice versa. Invoke the hasArray method before invoking this method in order to ensure that this buffer has an accessible backing array.
Sets the designated parameter in this RowSet object's command to the given input stream .  When a very large binary value is input to a LONGVARBINARY parameter ,  it may be more practical to send it via a java . io . InputStream object .  The data will be read from the stream as needed until end - of - file is reached .  Note: This stream object can either be a standard Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the standard interface .  Note: Consult your JDBC driver documentation to determine if it might be more efficient to use a version of setBinaryStream which takes a length parameter .

"Returns the string representation (display name )  of the calendar field value in the given style and locale. If no string representation is applicable, null is returned. field is a Calendar field index, such as Calendar.MONTH. The time zone fields, Calendar.ZONE _ OFFSET and Calendar.DST _ OFFSET, are not supported by this method. null must be returned if any time zone fields are specified. value is the numeric representation of the field value. For example, if field is Calendar.DAY _ OF _ WEEK, the valid values are Calendar.SUNDAY to Calendar.SATURDAY (inclusive ) . style gives the style of the string representation. It is one of Calendar.SHORT _ FORMAT (SHORT ) , Calendar.SHORT _ STANDALONE, Calendar.LONG _ FORMAT (LONG ) , Calendar.LONG _ STANDALONE, Calendar.NARROW _ FORMAT, or Calendar.NARROW _ STANDALONE. For example, the following call will return ""Sunday"". getDisplayName(""gregory"", Calendar.DAY _ OF _ WEEK, Calendar.SUNDAY, Calendar.LONG _ STANDALONE, Locale.ENGLISH ) ;"
Adds a PropertyChangeListener to the list of listeners for the specific property .  The following properties are currently supported: Property Description trayIcons The SystemTray's array of TrayIcon objects .  The array is accessed via the getTrayIcons( )  method .  This property is changed when a tray icon is added to (or removed from )  the system tray .  For example ,  this property is changed when the system tray becomes unavailable on the desktop and the tray icons are automatically removed .  systemTray This property contains SystemTray instance when the system tray is available or null otherwise .  This property is changed when the system tray becomes available or unavailable on the desktop .  The property is accessed by the getSystemTray( )  method .  The listener listens to property changes only in this context .  If listener is null ,  no exception is thrown and no action is performed . 
Sets the size of this vector .  If the new size is greater than the current size ,  new null items are added to the end of the vector .  If the new size is less than the current size ,  all components at index newSize and greater are discarded . 
Prints each of the components in this container . 
Returns the hash code value for this response APDU . 
Returns the java . lang . Class object for a proxy class given a class loader and an array of interfaces .  The proxy class will be defined by the specified class loader and will implement all of the supplied interfaces .  If any of the given interfaces is non - public ,  the proxy class will be non - public .  If a proxy class for the same permutation of interfaces has already been defined by the class loader ,  then the existing proxy class will be returned; otherwise ,  a proxy class for those interfaces will be generated dynamically and defined by the class loader .  There are several restrictions on the parameters that may be passed to Proxy . getProxyClass: All of the Class objects in the interfaces array must represent interfaces ,  not classes or primitive types .  No two elements in the interfaces array may refer to identical Class objects .  All of the interface types must be visible by name through the specified class loader .  In other words ,  for class loader cl and every interface i ,  the following expression must be true: Class . forName ( i . getName ( ) ,  false ,  cl) == i All non - public interfaces must be in the same package; otherwise ,  it would not be possible for the proxy class to implement all of the interfaces ,  regardless of what package it is defined in .  For any set of member methods of the specified interfaces that have the same signature: If the return type of any of the methods is a primitive type or void ,  then all of the methods must have that same return type .  Otherwise ,  one of the methods must have a return type that is assignable to all of the return types of the rest of the methods .  The resulting proxy class must not exceed any limits imposed on classes by the virtual machine .  For example ,  the VM may limit the number of interfaces that a class may implement to 65535; in that case ,  the size of the interfaces array must not exceed 65535 .  If any of these restrictions are violated ,  Proxy . getProxyClass will throw an IllegalArgumentException .  If the interfaces array argument or any of its elements are null ,  a NullPointerException will be thrown .  Note that the order of the specified proxy interfaces is significant: two requests for a proxy class with the same combination of interfaces but in a different order will result in two distinct proxy classes . 
Get the character stream that was set with setWriter . 
Returns the thread in which this event has occurred .  In rare cases ,  this event may occur in a debugger system thread within the target VM .  Debugger threads take precautions to prevent these events ,  but they cannot be avoided under some conditions ,  especially for some subclasses of Error .  If the event was generated by a debugger system thread ,  the value returned by this method is null ,  and if the requested suspend policy for the event was EventRequest . SUSPEND _ EVENT _ THREAD ,  all threads will be suspended instead ,  and the EventSet . suspendPolicy( )  will reflect this change .  Note that the discussion above does not apply to system threads created by the target VM during its normal (non - debug )  operation . 
Compares the specified object with this list for equality. Returns true if the specified object is the same object as this object ,  or if it is also a List and the sequence of elements returned by an iterator over the specified list is the same as the sequence returned by an iterator over this list. The two sequences are considered to be the same if they have the same length and corresponding elements at the same position in the sequence are equal. Two elements e1 and e2 are considered equal if (e1==null ? e2==null : e1.equals(e2 )  ) .

Creates a stack trace element representing the specified execution point . 
Immediately performs the base action of this task and returns true if, upon return from this method, this task is guaranteed to have completed normally .  This method may return false otherwise, to indicate that this task is not necessarily complete (or is not known to be complete ) , for example in asynchronous actions that require explicit invocations of completion methods .  This method may also throw an (unchecked )  exception to indicate abnormal exit .  This method is designed to support extensions, and should not in general be called otherwise . 
Creates a RenderedImage that represented a rendering of this image using a given RenderContext .  This is the most general way to obtain a rendering of a RenderableImage .  The created RenderedImage may have a property identified by the String HINTS _ OBSERVED to indicate which RenderingHints (from the RenderContext )  were used to create the image .  In addition any RenderedImages that are obtained via the getSources( )  method on the created RenderedImage may have such a property . 
"Construct a locale from a language code .  This constructor normalizes the language value to lowercase .  Note: ISO 639 is not a stable standard; some of the language codes it defines (specifically ""iw"", ""ji"", and ""in"" )  have changed .  This constructor accepts both the old codes (""iw"", ""ji"", and ""in"" )  and the new codes (""he"", ""yi"", and ""id"" ) , but all other API on Locale will return only the OLD codes .  For backward compatibility reasons, this constructor does not make any syntactic checks on the input . "
Returns the parent WritableRaster (if any )  of this WritableRaster ,  or else null . 
Compares this descriptor to the given object .  The objects are equal if the given object is also a Descriptor ,  and if the two Descriptors have the same field names (possibly differing in case )  and the same associated values .  The respective values for a field in the two Descriptors are equal if the following conditions hold: If one value is null then the other must be too .  If one value is a primitive array then the other must be a primitive array of the same type with the same elements .  If one value is an object array then the other must be too and Arrays . deepEquals must return true .  Otherwise Object . equals(Object )  must return true .

Advances the current position to the next component .  The operation returns true while the resulting current position indicates a component ,  false otherwise .  A false return value leaves the current position at -1 .  Invoking next on a DynAny without components leaves the current position at -1 and returns false . 
Obtains a period for this chronology based on years ,  months and days .  This returns a period tied to this chronology using the specified years ,  months and days .  All supplied chronologies use periods based on years ,  months and days ,  however the ChronoPeriod API allows the period to be represented using other units . 
Returns the length of the month represented by this date .  This returns the length of the month in days .  Month lengths in the Hijrah calendar system vary between 29 and 30 days . 
Populates this object with data read from the database. The implementation of the method must follow this protocol: It must read each of the attributes or elements of the SQL type from the given input stream. This is done by calling a method of the input stream to read each item ,  in the order that they appear in the SQL definition of the type. The method readSQL then assigns the data to appropriate fields or elements (of this or other objects ) . Specifically ,  it must call the appropriate reader method (SQLInput.readString ,  SQLInput.readBigDecimal ,  and so on )  method(s )  to do the following: for a distinct type ,  read its single data element; for a structured type ,  read a value for each attribute of the SQL type. The JDBC driver initializes the input stream with a type map before calling this method ,  which is used by the appropriate SQLInput reader method on the stream.

This method returns a the currently available DataFlavors of the Transferable operand as a java . util . List . 
Removes keyboard focus from this element . 
Returns an array of all the objects currently registered as FooListeners upon this model .  FooListeners are registered using the addFooListener method .  You can specify the listenerType argument with a class literal ,  such as FooListener . class .  For example ,  you can query a DefaultTreeSelectionModel m for its tree selection listeners with the following code: TreeSelectionListener [ ] tsls = (TreeSelectionListener [ ] ) (m . getListeners(TreeSelectionListener . class )  ) ; If no such listeners exist ,  this method returns an empty array .

Returns an integer number format for the specified locale. The returned number format is configured to round floating point numbers to the nearest integer using half - even rounding (see RoundingMode.HALF _ EVEN )  for formatting ,  and to parse only the integer part of an input string (see isParseIntegerOnly ) .
Gets the font metrics for the specified font .  Warning: Since Font metrics are affected by the FontRenderContext and this method does not provide one ,  it can return only metrics for the default render context which may not match that used when rendering on the Component if Graphics2D functionality is being used .  Instead metrics can be obtained at rendering time by calling Graphics . getFontMetrics ( ) or text measurement APIs on the Font class . 
Formats this year using the specified formatter .  This year will be passed to the formatter to produce a string . 
Useful constant for language . 
Returns the hash code value for this object . 
Inserts the specified element into this delay queue .  As the queue is unbounded this method will never block .

If the application knows the character encoding of the byte stream ,  it should set the encoding attribute .  Setting the encoding in this way will override any encoding specified in an XML declaration in the data . 
Draw the icon at the specified location .  Icon implementations may use the Component argument to get properties useful for painting ,  e . g .  the foreground or background color . 
The number of 16 - bit units that are available through data and the substringData method below .  This may have the value zero ,  i . e .  ,  CharacterData nodes may be empty . 
Return the command's class name .  This method MAY return null in cases where a CommandMap subclassed CommandInfo for its own purposes .  In other words ,  it might not be possible to create the correct state in the command by merely knowing its class name .  DO NOT DEPEND ON THIS METHOD RETURNING A VALID VALUE!
Returns a CharSequence that is a subsequence of this sequence .  The subsequence starts with the char value at the specified index and ends with the char value at index end - 1 .  The length (in chars )  of the returned sequence is end - start ,  so if start == end then an empty sequence is returned . 
Gets the nano - of - second field . 
Creates an element of the type specified .  Note that the instance returned implements the Element interface ,  so attributes can be specified directly on the returned object .  In addition ,  if there are known attributes with default values ,  Attr nodes representing them are automatically created and attached to the element .  To create an element with a qualified name and namespace URI ,  use the createElementNS method . 
Resizes this object so that it has width and height . 
Returns the Tab instance after location .  This will return null if there are no tabs after location . 
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array. The returned array elements are in no particular order. If the queue fits in the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this queue. If this queue fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e., the array has more elements than this queue ) , the element in the array immediately following the end of the queue is set to null. Like the toArray( )  method, this method acts as bridge between array - based and collection - based APIs. Further, this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may, under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs. The following code can be used to dump a delay queue into a newly allocated array of Delayed: Delayed [ ] a = q.toArray(new Delayed [ 0] ) ; Note that toArray(new Object [ 0] )  is identical in function to toArray( ) .
Value for twelve month of year . 
"Returns the value of the named parameter in the HTML tag .  For example ,  if an applet is specified as <applet code=""Clock"" width=50 height=50 >  <param name=Color value=""blue"" >  </applet >  then a call to getParameter ( ""Color"" )  returns the value ""blue"" . "
Returns the index of the first character of the run with respect to the given attributes containing the current character . 
Outputs this offset as a String ,  using the normalized ID . 
Gets the foreground color of this object . 
Tests whether two nodes are equal. This method tests for equality of nodes ,  not sameness (i.e. ,  whether the two nodes are references to the same object )  which can be tested with Node.isSameNode( ) . All nodes that are the same will also be equal ,  though the reverse may not be true. Two nodes are equal if and only if the following conditions are satisfied: The two nodes are of the same type. The following string attributes are equal: nodeName ,  localName ,  namespaceURI ,  prefix ,  nodeValue . This is: they are both null ,  or they have the same length and are character for character identical. The attributes NamedNodeMaps are equal. This is: they are both null ,  or they have the same length and for each node that exists in one map there is a node that exists in the other map and is equal ,  although not necessarily at the same index. The childNodes NodeLists are equal. This is: they are both null ,  or they have the same length and contain equal nodes at the same index. Note that normalization can affect equality; to avoid this ,  nodes should be normalized before being compared. For two DocumentType nodes to be equal ,  the following conditions must also be satisfied: The following string attributes are equal: publicId ,  systemId ,  internalSubset. The entities NamedNodeMaps are equal. The notations NamedNodeMaps are equal. On the other hand ,  the following do not affect equality: the ownerDocument ,  baseURI ,  and parentNode attributes ,  the specified attribute for Attr nodes ,  the schemaTypeInfo attribute for Attr and Element nodes ,  the Text.isElementContentWhitespace attribute for Text nodes ,  as well as any user data or event listeners registered on the nodes. Note: As a general rule ,  anything not mentioned in the description above is not significant in consideration of equality checking. Note that future versions of this specification may take into account more attributes and implementations conform to this specification are expected to be updated accordingly.

Returns the String representation of this Rectangle2D . 
Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered .  This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed .  For example ,  on a LocalDate ,  this could be used to set the year ,  month or day - of - month .  The returned object will have the same observable type as this object .  In some cases ,  changing a field is not fully defined .  For example ,  if the target object is a date representing the 31st January ,  then changing the month to February would be unclear .  In cases like this ,  the field is responsible for resolving the result .  Typically it will choose the previous valid date ,  which would be the last valid day of February in this example . 
Sets the divider location as a percentage of the JSplitPane's size. This method is implemented in terms of setDividerLocation(int ) . This method immediately changes the size of the split pane based on its current size. If the split pane is not correctly realized and on screen ,  this method will have no effect (new divider location will become (current size * proportionalLocation )  which is 0 ) .

The ISO date formatter that formats or parses a date without an offset ,  such as '20111203'. This returns an immutable formatter capable of formatting and parsing the ISO - 8601 basic local date format. The format consists of: Four digits for the year. Only years in the range 0000 to 9999 are supported. Two digits for the month - of - year. This is pre - padded by zero to ensure two digits. Two digits for the day - of - month. This is pre - padded by zero to ensure two digits. If the offset is not available to format or parse then the format is complete. The offset ID without colons. If the offset has seconds then they will be handled even though this is not part of the ISO - 8601 standard. Parsing is case insensitive. As this formatter has an optional element ,  it may be necessary to parse using parseBest ( java.lang.CharSequence ,  java.time.temporal.TemporalQuery < ? > ... ) . The returned formatter has a chronology of ISO set to ensure dates in other calendar systems are correctly converted. It has no override zone and uses the STRICT resolver style.

The getPort method returns a proxy .  The parameter endpointReference specifies the endpoint that will be invoked by the returned proxy .  If there are any reference parameters in the endpointReference ,  then those reference parameters MUST appear as SOAP headers ,  indicating them to be reference parameters ,  on all messages sent to the endpoint .  The endpointReference's address MUST be used for invocations on the endpoint .  The parameter serviceEndpointInterface specifies the service endpoint interface that is supported by the returned proxy .  In the implementation of this method ,  the JAX - WS runtime system takes the responsibility of selecting a protocol binding (and a port )  and configuring the proxy accordingly from the WSDL associated with this Service instance or from the metadata from the endpointReference .  If this Service instance has a WSDL and the endpointReference metadata also has a WSDL ,  then the WSDL from this instance MUST be used .  If this Service instance does not have a WSDL and the endpointReference does have a WSDL ,  then the WSDL from the endpointReference MAY be used .  The returned proxy should not be reconfigured by the client .  If this Service instance has a known proxy port that matches the information contained in the WSDL ,  then that proxy is returned ,  otherwise a WebServiceException is thrown .  Calling this method has the same behavior as the following port = service . getPort(portName ,  serviceEndpointInterface ) ; where the portName is retrieved from the metadata of the endpointReference or from the serviceEndpointInterface and the WSDL associated with this Service instance .

Compare this MBeanFeatureInfo to another . 
"Tests whether one method ,  as a member of a given type ,  overrides another method. When a non - abstract method overrides an abstract one ,  the former is also said to implement the latter. In the simplest and most typical usage ,  the value of the type parameter will simply be the class or interface directly enclosing overrider (the possibly - overriding method ) . For example ,  suppose m1 represents the method String.hashCode and m2 represents Object.hashCode. We can then ask whether m1 overrides m2 within the class String (it does ) : assert elements.overrides(m1 ,  m2 ,  elements.getTypeElement(""java.lang.String"" )  ) ; A more interesting case can be illustrated by the following example in which a method in type A does not override a like - named method in type B: class A { public void m( )  {} } interface B { void m( ) ; } ... m1 = ...; // A.m m2 = ...; // B.m assert ! elements.overrides(m1 ,  m2 ,  elements.getTypeElement(""A"" )  ) ; When viewed as a member of a third type C ,  however ,  the method in A does override the one in B: class C extends A implements B {} ... assert elements.overrides(m1 ,  m2 ,  elements.getTypeElement(""C"" )  ) ;"
Creates a transition instance for the specified year .  Calculations are performed using the ISO - 8601 chronology . 
Gets whether the specified JComponent is in the custom state represented by this class .  This is an extremely performance sensitive loop .  Please take proper precautions to ensure that it executes quickly .  Nimbus uses this method to help determine what state a JComponent is in .  For example ,  a custom State could exist for JProgressBar such that it would return true when the progress bar is indeterminate .  Such an implementation of this method would simply be: return c . isIndeterminate ( );
"Gets the previous transition before the specified instant .  This returns details of the previous transition after the specified instant .  For example ,  if the instant represents a point where ""summer"" daylight saving time applies ,  then the method will return the transition from the previous ""winter"" time . "
Constructs a new printer name attribute with the given name and locale . 
Constructs a CommandAPDU from the four header bytes and command data .  This is case 3 in ISO 7816 ,  command data present and Ne absent .  The value Nc is taken as dataLength .

Creates a socket address from an IP address and a port number .  A valid port value is between 0 and 65535 .  A port number of zero will let the system pick up an ephemeral port in a bind operation .  A null address will assign the wildcard address . 
Sets the designated parameter in this RowSet object's command to the given input stream .  When a very large binary value is input to a LONGVARBINARY parameter ,  it may be more practical to send it via a java . io . InputStream object .  The data will be read from the stream as needed until end - of - file is reached .  Note: This stream object can either be a standard Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the standard interface .  Note: Consult your JDBC driver documentation to determine if it might be more efficient to use a version of setBinaryStream which takes a length parameter . 
Constructs an INTERNAL exception with the specified detail message ,  minor code ,  and completion status .  A detail message is a String that describes this particular exception .

Obtains a list of instruments that come with the synthesizer .  These instruments might be built into the synthesizer ,  or they might be part of a default soundbank provided with the synthesizer ,  etc .  Note that you don't use this method to find out which instruments are currently loaded onto the synthesizer; for that purpose ,  you use getLoadedInstruments ( ) .  Nor does the method indicate all the instruments that can be loaded onto the synthesizer; it only indicates the subset that come with the synthesizer .  To learn whether another instrument can be loaded ,  you can invoke isSoundbankSupported ( ) ,  and if the instrument's Soundbank is supported ,  you can try loading the instrument .

Tests if the interior of the Shape entirely contains the specified Rectangle2D .  The Shape . contains ( ) method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return false when: the intersect method returns true and the calculations to determine whether or not the Shape entirely contains the Rectangle2D are prohibitively expensive .  This means that for some Shapes this method might return false even though the Shape contains the Rectangle2D .  The Area class performs more accurate geometric computations than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required .  This method object may conservatively return false in cases where the specified rectangular area intersects a segment of the path ,  but that segment does not represent a boundary between the interior and exterior of the path .  Such segments could lie entirely within the interior of the path if they are part of a path with a WIND _ NON _ ZERO winding rule or if the segments are retraced in the reverse direction such that the two sets of segments cancel each other out without any exterior area falling between them .  To determine whether segments represent true boundaries of the interior of the path would require extensive calculations involving all of the segments of the path and the winding rule and are thus beyond the scope of this implementation .

When the keepalive option is set for a TCP socket and no data has been exchanged across the socket in either direction for 2 hours (NOTE: the actual value is implementation dependent ) , TCP automatically sends a keepalive probe to the peer. This probe is a TCP segment to which the peer must respond. One of three responses is expected: 1. The peer responds with the expected ACK. The application is not notified (since everything is OK ) . TCP will send another probe following another 2 hours of inactivity. 2. The peer responds with an RST, which tells the local TCP that the peer host has crashed and rebooted. The socket is closed. 3. There is no response from the peer. The socket is closed. The purpose of this option is to detect if the peer host crashes. Valid only for TCP socket: SocketImpl

The milli - of - second .  This counts the millisecond within the second ,  from 0 to 999 .  This field has the same meaning for all calendar systems .  This field is used to represent the milli - of - second handling any fraction of the second .  Implementations of TemporalAccessor should provide a value for this field if they can return a value for SECOND _ OF _ MINUTE ,  SECOND _ OF _ DAY or INSTANT _ SECONDS filling unknown precision with zero .  When this field is used for setting a value ,  it should behave in the same way as setting NANO _ OF _ SECOND with the value multiplied by 1 , 000 , 000 .  When parsing this field it behaves equivalent to the following: The value is validated in strict and smart mode but not in lenient mode .  The field is resolved in combination with MICRO _ OF _ SECOND to produce NANO _ OF _ SECOND .

The communication channel to the target VM is closed ,  and the target VM prepares to accept another subsequent connection from this debugger or another debugger ,  including the following tasks: All event requests are cancelled. All threads suspended by suspend( )  or by ThreadReference.suspend( )  are resumed as many times as necessary for them to run. Garbage collection is re - enabled in all cases where it was disabled through ObjectReference.disableCollection( ) . Any current method invocations executing in the target VM are continued after the disconnection. Upon completion of any such method invocation ,  the invoking thread continues from the location where it was originally stopped. Resources originating in this VirtualMachine (ObjectReferences ,  ReferenceTypes ,  etc. )  will become invalid.

Makes the Dialog visible .  If the dialog and/or its owner are not yet displayable ,  both are made displayable .  The dialog will be validated prior to being made visible .  If the dialog is already visible ,  this will bring the dialog to the front .  If the dialog is modal and is not already visible ,  this call will not return until the dialog is hidden by calling hide or dispose .  It is permissible to show modal dialogs from the event dispatching thread because the toolkit will ensure that another event pump runs while the one which invoked this method is blocked . 
Default modality type for modal dialogs. The default modality type is APPLICATION _ MODAL. Calling the oldstyle setModal ( true )  is equal to setModalityType ( DEFAULT _ MODALITY _ TYPE ) .
A style specifier for getDisplayName and getDisplayNames indicating a long name used independently ,  such as a month name as calendar headers . 
"Returns an array of Strings that may be used along with getCompressionQualityValues as part of a user interface for setting or displaying the compression quality level. The String with index i provides a description of the range of quality levels between getCompressionQualityValues[i ]  and getCompressionQualityValues[i + 1 ] . Note that the length of the array returned from getCompressionQualityValues will always be one greater than that returned from getCompressionQualityDescriptions. As an example ,  the strings ""Good"" ,  ""Better"" ,  and ""Best"" could be associated with the ranges [0 ,  .33) ,  [.33 ,  .66) ,  and [.66 ,  1.0 ] . In this case ,  getCompressionQualityDescriptions would return { ""Good"" ,  ""Better"" ,  ""Best"" } and getCompressionQualityValues would return { 0.0F ,  .33F ,  .66F ,  1.0F }. If no descriptions are available ,  null is returned. If null is returned from getCompressionQualityValues ,  this method must also return null. The descriptions should be localized for the Locale returned by getLocale ,  if it is non - null. If there are multiple compression types but none has been set ,  an IllegalStateException is thrown. The default implementation checks that compression is supported and that the compression mode is MODE _ EXPLICIT. If so ,  if getCompressionTypes ( ) is null or getCompressionType ( ) is non - null ,  it returns null."

Adds an ActionListener to the file chooser . 
Enables or disables the current input method for composition ,  depending on the value of the parameter enable .  An input method that is enabled for composition interprets incoming events for both composition and control purposes ,  while a disabled input method does not interpret events for composition .  Note however that events are passed on to the input method regardless whether it is enabled or not ,  and that an input method that is disabled for composition may still interpret events for control purposes ,  including to enable or disable itself for composition .  For input methods provided by host operating systems ,  it is not always possible to determine whether this operation is supported .  For example ,  an input method may enable composition only for some locales ,  and do nothing for other locales .  For such input methods ,  it is possible that this method does not throw UnsupportedOperationException ,  but also does not affect whether composition is enabled . 
Returns the base g .

Removes the specified object from the set of observed MBeans . 
Reads a byte from the stream ,  and (conceptually )  converts it to an int ,  masks it with 0xff in order to strip off any sign - extension bits ,  and returns it as a byte value .  Thus ,  byte values between 0x00 and 0x7f are simply returned as integer values between 0 and 127 .  Values between 0x80 and 0xff ,  which normally represent negative bytevalues ,  will be mapped into positive integers between 128 and 255 .  The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before the read occurs . 
Instantiates and registers an MBean in the MBean server. The MBean server will use its Default Loader Repository to load the class of the MBean. An object name is associated with the MBean. If the object name given is null ,  the MBean must provide its own name by implementing the MBeanRegistration interface and returning the name from the preRegister method. This method is equivalent to createMBean(className ,  name ,  (Object [ ] )  null ,  (String [ ] )  null ) .

"A query that provides access to the excess days that were parsed .  This returns a singleton query that provides access to additional information from the parse .  The query always returns a non - null period ,  with a zero period returned instead of null .  There are two situations where this query may return a non - zero period .  If the ResolverStyle is LENIENT and a time is parsed without a date ,  then the complete result of the parse consists of a LocalTime and an excess Period in days .  If the ResolverStyle is SMART and a time is parsed without a date where the time is 24:00:00 ,  then the complete result of the parse consists of a LocalTime of 00:00:00 and an excess Period of one day .  In both cases ,  if a complete ChronoLocalDateTime or Instant is parsed ,  then the excess days are added to the date part .  As a result ,  this query will return a zero period .  The SMART behaviour handles the common ""end of day"" 24:00 value .  Processing in LENIENT mode also produces the same result: Text to parse Parsed object Excess days ""2012 - 12 - 03T00:00"" LocalDateTime . of ( 2012 ,  12 ,  3 ,  0 ,  0) ZERO ""2012 - 12 - 03T24:00"" LocalDateTime . of ( 2012 ,  12 ,  4 ,  0 ,  0) ZERO ""00:00"" LocalTime . of ( 0 ,  0) ZERO ""24:00"" LocalTime . of ( 0 ,  0) Period . ofDays ( 1) The query can be used as follows: TemporalAccessor parsed = formatter . parse ( str); LocalTime time = parsed . query ( LocalTime::from); Period extraDays = parsed . query ( DateTimeFormatter . parsedExcessDays ( ));"

This method traverses the list of registered security Providers ,  starting with the most preferred Provider .  A new TerminalFactory object encapsulating the TerminalFactorySpi implementation from the first Provider that supports the specified type is returned .  Note that the list of registered providers may be retrieved via the Security . getProviders ( ) method .  The TerminalFactory is initialized with the specified parameters Object .  The type of parameters needed may vary between different types of TerminalFactorys . 
Initializes the value type's members from a sequence of NameValuePairs .  The operation sets the current position to zero if the passed sequences has non-zero length .  Otherwise ,  if an empty sequence is passed ,  the current position is set to -1 .  A null value type can be initialized to a non-null value type using this method .  Members must appear in the NameValuePairs in the order in which they appear in the IDL specification of the value type as indicated by the DynValue's TypeCode or they must be empty strings .  The operation makes no attempt to assign member values based on member names . 
Set the parameters to the log message . 
Intersects the current Clip with the interior of the specified Shape and sets the Clip to the resulting intersection .  The specified Shape is transformed with the current Graphics2D Transform before being intersected with the current Clip .  This method is used to make the current Clip smaller .  To make the Clip larger ,  use setClip .  The user clip modified by this method is independent of the clipping associated with device bounds and visibility .  If no clip has previously been set ,  or if the clip has been cleared using setClip with a null argument ,  the specified Shape becomes the new user clip . 
Return the DataFlavors in which this data is available .  Returns an array of DataFlavor objects indicating the flavors the data can be provided in .  The array is usually ordered according to preference for providing the data, from most richly descriptive to least richly descriptive .  The DataHandler attempts to find a DataContentHandler that corresponds to the MIME type of the data .  If one is located, the DataHandler calls the DataContentHandler's getTransferDataFlavors method .  If a DataContentHandler can not be located, and if the DataHandler was created with a DataSource (or URL ) , one DataFlavor is returned that represents this object's MIME type and the java . io . InputStream class .  If the DataHandler was created with an object and a MIME type, getTransferDataFlavors returns one DataFlavor that represents this object's MIME type and the object's class . 
Create a Bidi object representing the bidi information on a line of text within the paragraph represented by the current Bidi .  This call is not required if the entire paragraph fits on one line . 
Returns an array of unnormalized color/alpha components given a pixel in this ColorModel. The pixel value is specified as an int. An IllegalArgumentException will be thrown if pixel values for this ColorModel are not conveniently representable as a single int or if color component values for this ColorModel are not conveniently representable in the unnormalized form. For example ,  this method can be used to retrieve the components for a specific pixel value in a DirectColorModel. If the components array is null ,  a new array will be allocated. The components array will be returned. Color/alpha components are stored in the components array starting at offset (even if the array is allocated by this method ) . An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown if the components array is not null and is not large enough to hold all the color and alpha components (starting at offset ) . Since ColorModel is an abstract class ,  any instance is an instance of a subclass. Subclasses must override this method since the implementation in this abstract class throws an UnsupportedOperationException.
Get the state of this object .  Note: as of the Java 2 platform v1 . 3 ,  it is recommended that developers call Component . AccessibleAWTComponent . getAccessibleIndexInParent ( ) instead of using this method . 
Creates this toolkit's implementation of Choice using the specified peer interface . 
Reads up to len bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes .  An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes ,  but a smaller number may be read .  The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer .  This method blocks until input data is available ,  end of file is detected ,  or an exception is thrown .  If len is zero ,  then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise ,  there is an attempt to read at least one byte .  If no byte is available because the stream is at end of file ,  the value -1 is returned; otherwise ,  at least one byte is read and stored into b .  The first byte read is stored into element b [ off ]  ,  the next one into b [ off+1 ]  ,  and so on .  The number of bytes read is ,  at most ,  equal to len .  Let k be the number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements b [ off ]  through b [ off+k-1 ]  ,  leaving elements b [ off+k ]  through b [ off+len-1 ]  unaffected .  In every case ,  elements b [ 0 ]  through b [ off ]  and elements b [ off+len ]  through b [ b . length-1 ]  are unaffected .  The read ( b ,  off ,  len) method for class InputStream simply calls the method read ( ) repeatedly .  If the first such call results in an IOException ,  that exception is returned from the call to the read ( b ,  off ,  len) method .  If any subsequent call to read ( ) results in a IOException ,  the exception is caught and treated as if it were end of file; the bytes read up to that point are stored into b and the number of bytes read before the exception occurred is returned .  The default implementation of this method blocks until the requested amount of input data len has been read ,  end of file is detected ,  or an exception is thrown .  Subclasses are encouraged to provide a more efficient implementation of this method . 
Fetch the parser to use for reading HTML streams .  This can be reimplemented to provide a different parser .  The default implementation is loaded dynamically to avoid the overhead of loading the default parser if it's not used .  The default parser is the HotJava parser using an HTML 3 . 2 DTD . 
Creates a new auxiliary resource file for writing and returns a file object for it .  The file may be located along with the newly created source files, newly created binary files, or other supported location .  The locations CLASS _ OUTPUT and SOURCE _ OUTPUT must be supported .  The resource may be named relative to some package (as are source and class files ) , and from there by a relative pathname .  In a loose sense, the full pathname of the new file will be the concatenation of location, pkg, and relativeName .  Files created via this method are not registered for annotation processing, even if the full pathname of the file would correspond to the full pathname of a new source file or new class file . 
Returns the minimum number of digits allowed in the fraction portion of a number . 
Handles document remove (fire appropriate property change event ,  which is AccessibleContext.ACCESSIBLE _ TEXT _ PROPERTY ) . This tracks the changed offset via the event.
Concatenates the current Graphics2D Transform with a shearing transform .  Subsequent renderings are sheared by the specified multiplier relative to the previous position .  This is equivalent to calling transform ( SH ) , where SH is an AffineTransform represented by the following matrix: [ 1 shx 0 ] [ shy 1 0 ] [ 0 0 1 ]
Returns the enum constant of this type with the specified name .  The string must match exactly an identifier used to declare an enum constant in this type .  (Extraneous whitespace characters are not permitted .  ) 
Binds a name to an object ,  along with associated attributes .  If attrs is null ,  the resulting binding will have the attributes associated with obj if obj is a DirContext ,  and no attributes otherwise .  If attrs is non - null ,  the resulting binding will have attrs as its attributes; any attributes associated with obj are ignored .

Caller should not modify mutable keys and values in environment after it has been passed to the constructor . 
"An int representing a ""move"" action . "
Returns an OptionalDouble describing the arithmetic mean of elements of this stream ,  or an empty optional if this stream is empty .  If any recorded value is a NaN or the sum is at any point a NaN then the average will be NaN .  The average returned can vary depending upon the order in which values are recorded .  This method may be implemented using compensated summation or other technique to reduce the error bound in the numerical sum used to compute the average .  The average is a special case of a reduction .  This is a terminal operation . 
Returns the local address of this server socket .  If the socket was bound prior to being closed ,  then this method will continue to return the local address after the socket is closed .  If there is a security manager set ,  its checkConnect method is called with the local address and -1 as its arguments to see if the operation is allowed .  If the operation is not allowed ,  the loopback address is returned . 
All tracing is enabled . 
Writes a sequence of bytes to the stream at the current position .  If len is 0 ,  nothing is written .  The byte b [ off ]  is written first ,  then the byte b [ off + 1 ]  ,  and so on .  If the bit offset within the stream is non - zero ,  the remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s and written out first .  The bit offset will be 0 after the write .  Implementers can use the flushBits method of ImageOutputStreamImpl to guarantee this . 
Returns the reshow delay property . 
Clear the attribute list .  SAX parser writers can use this method to reset the attribute list between DocumentHandler . startElement events .  Normally ,  it will make sense to reuse the same AttributeListImpl object rather than allocating a new one each time . 
Clears the specified rectangle by filling it with the background color of the current drawing surface .  This operation does not use the current paint mode .  Beginning with Java 1 . 1 ,  the background color of offscreen images may be system dependent .  Applications should use setColor followed by fillRect to ensure that an offscreen image is cleared to a specific color . 
Invokes the getPreferredSize method on each UI handled by this object . 
Convert this XMLGregorianCalendar along with provided parameters to a GregorianCalendar instance .  Since XML Schema 1 . 0 date/time datetypes has no concept of timezone ids or daylight savings timezone ids ,  this conversion operation allows the user to explicitly specify one with timezone parameter .  To compute the return value's TimeZone field ,  when parameter timeZone is non - null ,  it is the timezone field .  else when this . getTimezone ( ) != FIELD _ UNDEFINED ,  create a java . util . TimeZone with a custom timezone id using the this . getTimezone ( ) .  else when defaults . getTimezone ( ) != FIELD _ UNDEFINED ,  create a java . util . TimeZone with a custom timezone id using defaults . getTimezone ( ) .  else use the GregorianCalendar default timezone value for the host is defined as specified by java . util . TimeZone . getDefault ( ) .  To ensure consistency in conversion implementations ,  the new GregorianCalendar should be instantiated in following manner .  Create a new java . util . GregorianCalendar ( TimeZone ,  Locale) with TimeZone set as specified above and the Locale parameter .  Initialize all GregorianCalendar fields by calling Calendar . clear ( ) Obtain a pure Gregorian Calendar by invoking GregorianCalendar . setGregorianChange (  new Date ( Long . MIN _ VALUE)) .

Produces a method handle which returns its sole argument when invoked . 
The name of the minValue field . 
Returns a synchronized (thread - safe )  sorted set backed by the specified sorted set. In order to guarantee serial access ,  it is critical that all access to the backing sorted set is accomplished through the returned sorted set (or its views ) . It is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned sorted set when iterating over it or any of its subSet ,  headSet ,  or tailSet views. SortedSet s = Collections.synchronizedSortedSet(new TreeSet( )  ) ; ... synchronized (s )  { Iterator i = s.iterator( ) ; // Must be in the synchronized block while (i.hasNext( )  )  foo(i.next( )  ) ; } or: SortedSet s = Collections.synchronizedSortedSet(new TreeSet( )  ) ; SortedSet s2 = s.headSet(foo ) ; ... synchronized (s )  { // Note: s ,  not s2!!! Iterator i = s2.iterator( ) ; // Must be in the synchronized block while (i.hasNext( )  )  foo(i.next( )  ) ; } Failure to follow this advice may result in non - deterministic behavior. The returned sorted set will be serializable if the specified sorted set is serializable.
Sets the thread that currently owns exclusive access .  A null argument indicates that no thread owns access .  This method does not otherwise impose any synchronization or volatile field accesses . 
Protected constructor may be called only by subclasses .

The curve is interpolated by solving the parametric control equation in the range (t= [ 0..1 ]  )  using the most recently specified (current )  point (CP ) , the first control point (P1 ) , the second control point (P2 ) , and the final interpolated control point (P3 ) . The parametric control equation for this curve is: P(t )  = B(3,0 ) *CP + B(3,1 ) *P1 + B(3,2 ) *P2 + B(3,3 ) *P3 0 <= t <= 1 B(n,m )  = mth coefficient of nth degree Bernstein polynomial = C(n,m )  * t^(m )  * (1 - t ) ^(n-m )  C(n,m )  = Combinations of n things, taken m at a time = n! / (m! * (n-m ) ! )  This form of curve is commonly known as a BÃ©zier curve.

Creates and executes a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the given initial delay ,  and subsequently with the given period; that is executions will commence after initialDelay then initialDelay+period ,  then initialDelay + 2 * period ,  and so on .  If any execution of the task encounters an exception ,  subsequent executions are suppressed .  Otherwise ,  the task will only terminate via cancellation or termination of the executor .  If any execution of this task takes longer than its period ,  then subsequent executions may start late ,  but will not concurrently execute . 
Adds a new attribute .  If an attribute with the same local name and namespace URI is already present on the element, its prefix is changed to be the prefix part of the qualifiedName, and its value is changed to be the value parameter .  This value is a simple string; it is not parsed as it is being set .  So any markup (such as syntax to be recognized as an entity reference )  is treated as literal text, and needs to be appropriately escaped by the implementation when it is written out .  In order to assign an attribute value that contains entity references, the user must create an Attr node plus any Text and EntityReference nodes, build the appropriate subtree, and use setAttributeNodeNS or setAttributeNode to assign it as the value of an attribute .  Per [XML Namespaces ]  , applications must use the value null as the namespaceURI parameter for methods if they wish to have no namespace . 
"Gets the offset applicable at the specified local date - time in these rules .  The mapping from a local date - time to an offset is not straightforward .  There are three cases: Normal ,  with one valid offset .  For the vast majority of the year ,  the normal case applies ,  where there is a single valid offset for the local date - time .  Gap ,  with zero valid offsets .  This is when clocks jump forward typically due to the spring daylight savings change from ""winter"" to ""summer"" .  In a gap there are local date - time values with no valid offset .  Overlap ,  with two valid offsets .  This is when clocks are set back typically due to the autumn daylight savings change from ""summer"" to ""winter"" .  In an overlap there are local date - time values with two valid offsets .  Thus ,  for any given local date - time there can be zero ,  one or two valid offsets .  This method returns that list of valid offsets ,  which is a list of size 0 ,  1 or 2 .  In the case where there are two offsets ,  the earlier offset is returned at index 0 and the later offset at index 1 .  There are various ways to handle the conversion from a LocalDateTime .  One technique ,  using this method ,  would be: List < ZoneOffset >  validOffsets = rules . getOffset(localDT ) ; if (validOffsets . size( )  == 1 )  { // Normal case: only one valid offset zoneOffset = validOffsets . get(0 ) ; } else { // Gap or Overlap: determine what to do from transition (which will be non - null )  ZoneOffsetTransition trans = rules . getTransition(localDT ) ; } In theory ,  it is possible for there to be more than two valid offsets .  This would happen if clocks to be put back more than once in quick succession .  This has never happened in the history of time - zones and thus has no special handling .  However ,  if it were to happen ,  then the list would return more than 2 entries . "

Check if there are any listeners for a specific property ,  including those registered on all properties .  If propertyName is null ,  only check for listeners registered on all properties . 
Loads a class from a codebase URL path ,  optionally using the supplied loader .  This method should be used when the caller would like to make available to the provider implementation an additional contextual class loader to consider ,  such as the loader of a caller on the stack .  Typically ,  a provider implementation will attempt to resolve the named class using the given defaultLoader ,  if specified ,  before attempting to resolve the class from the codebase URL path .  This method delegates to the RMIClassLoaderSpi . loadClass ( String , String , ClassLoader )  method of the provider instance ,  passing codebase as the first argument ,  name as the second argument ,  and defaultLoader as the third argument . 
Handles one option .  If current is an option to this file manager it will consume any arguments to that option from remaining and return true ,  otherwise return false .

"Constructor used to activate/export the object on a specified port. An ""activatable"" remote object must have a constructor that takes two arguments: the object's activation identifier (ActivationID ) , and the object's initialization data (a MarshalledObject ) . A concrete subclass of this class must call this constructor when it is activated via the two parameter constructor described above. As a side - effect of construction, the remote object is ""exported"" to the RMI runtime (on the specified port )  and is available to accept incoming calls from clients."
Connects this stub to an ORB. Required after the stub is deserialized but not after it is demarshalled by an ORB stream. If an unconnected stub is passed to an ORB stream for marshalling ,  it is implicitly connected to that ORB. Application code should not call this method directly ,  but should call the portable wrapper method PortableRemoteObject.connect ( java.rmi.Remote ,  java.rmi.Remote ) .
Constructs an ExpandVetoException object with no message . 
Sets this process builder's redirectErrorStream property .  If this property is true ,  then any error output generated by subprocesses subsequently started by this object's start ( ) method will be merged with the standard output ,  so that both can be read using the Process . getInputStream ( ) method .  This makes it easier to correlate error messages with the corresponding output .  The initial value is false .

Replace the context node with the result of the parse operation .  For this action to work ,  the context node must have a parent ,  and the parent must be an Element or a DocumentFragment . 
Receives a message into the given buffer and/or handles a notification .  If a message or notification is immediately available ,  or if this channel is in blocking mode and one eventually becomes available ,  then the message or notification is returned or handled ,  respectively .  If this channel is in non - blocking mode and a message or notification is not immediately available then this method immediately returns null .  If this method receives a message it is copied into the given byte buffer .  The message is transferred into the given byte buffer starting at its current position and the buffers position is incremented by the number of bytes read .  If there are fewer bytes remaining in the buffer than are required to hold the message ,  or the underlying input buffer does not contain the complete message ,  then an invocation of isComplete on the returned MessageInfo will return false ,  and more invocations of this method will be necessary to completely consume the messgae .  Only one message at a time will be partially delivered in any stream .  The socket option SCTP _ FRAGMENT _ INTERLEAVE controls various aspects of what interlacing of messages occurs .  If this method receives a notification then the appropriate method of the given handler ,  if there is one ,  is invoked .  If the handler returns CONTINUE then this method will try to receive another message/notification ,  otherwise ,  if RETURN is returned this method will return null .  If an uncaught exception is thrown by the handler it will be propagated up the stack through this method .  This method may be invoked at any time .  If another thread has already initiated a receive operation upon this channel ,  then an invocation of this method will block until the first operation is complete .  The given handler is invoked without holding any locks used to enforce the above synchronization policy ,  that way handlers will not stall other threads from receiving .  A handler should not invoke the receive method of this channel ,  if it does an IllegalReceiveException will be thrown . 
Adds one or more RowSet objects contained in the given array of RowSet objects to this JoinRowSet object and sets the match column for each of the RowSet objects to the match columns in the given array of column names .  The first element in columnName is set as the match column for the first RowSet object in rowset ,  the second element of columnName is set as the match column for the second element in rowset ,  and so on .  The first RowSet object added to this JoinRowSet object forms the basis for the JOIN relationship .  This method should be used when the given RowSet object ( s )  does not already have a match column . 
Removes the char at the specified position in this sequence .  This sequence is shortened by one char .  Note: If the character at the given index is a supplementary character, this method does not remove the entire character .  If correct handling of supplementary characters is required, determine the number of chars to remove by calling Character . charCount ( thisSequence . codePointAt ( index )  ) , where thisSequence is this sequence . 
Tests whether this Area object encloses any area . 
Attempts to release this lock .  If the current thread is the holder of this lock then the hold count is decremented .  If the hold count is now zero then the lock is released .  If the current thread is not the holder of this lock then IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown . 
Sets the RevocationEnabled flag. If this flag is true ,  the default revocation checking mechanism of the underlying PKIX service provider will be used. If this flag is false ,  the default revocation checking mechanism will be disabled (not used ) . When a PKIXParameters object is created ,  this flag is set to true. This setting reflects the most common strategy for checking revocation ,  since each service provider must support revocation checking to be PKIX compliant. Sophisticated applications should set this flag to false when it is not practical to use a PKIX service provider's default revocation checking mechanism or when an alternative revocation checking mechanism is to be substituted (by also calling the addCertPathChecker or setCertPathCheckers methods ) .

Retrieves and removes the head of this queue ,  waiting up to the specified wait time if necessary for an element to become available . 
Registers the designated output parameter .  This version of the method registerOutParameter should be used for a user - named or REF output parameter .  Examples of user - named types include: STRUCT ,  DISTINCT ,  JAVA _ OBJECT ,  and named array types .  All OUT parameters must be registered before a stored procedure is executed .  For a user - named parameter the fully - qualified SQL type name of the parameter should also be given ,  while a REF parameter requires that the fully - qualified type name of the referenced type be given .  A JDBC driver that does not need the type code and type name information may ignore it .  To be portable ,  however ,  applications should always provide these values for user - named and REF parameters .  Although it is intended for user - named and REF parameters ,  this method may be used to register a parameter of any JDBC type .  If the parameter does not have a user - named or REF type ,  the typeName parameter is ignored .  Note: When reading the value of an out parameter ,  you must use the getXXX method whose Java type XXX corresponds to the parameter's registered SQL type .  The default implementation will throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
Indicates whether this menu is a tear - off menu .  Tear - off functionality may not be supported by all implementations of AWT .  If a particular implementation doesn't support tear - off menus ,  this value is silently ignored .

Set an attribute in the list .  For the sake of speed ,  this method does no checking for name conflicts or well - formedness: such checks are the responsibility of the application . 
Removes the specified attribute node .  If a default value for the removed Attr node is defined in the DTD ,  a new node immediately appears with the default value as well as the corresponding namespace URI ,  local name ,  and prefix when applicable .  The implementation may handle default values from other schemas similarly but applications should use Document . normalizeDocument ( ) to guarantee this information is up - to - date . 
Holds the attribute's id .  It is initialized by the public constructor and cannot be null unless methods in BasicAttribute that use attrID have been overridden . 
A method to request the first DOM implementation that supports the specified features . 
Set the notification sequence number . 
Copies the specified range of the specified array into a new array. The initial index of the range (from )  must lie between zero and original.length, inclusive. The value at original [ from ]  is placed into the initial element of the copy (unless from == original.length or from == to ) . Values from subsequent elements in the original array are placed into subsequent elements in the copy. The final index of the range (to ) , which must be greater than or equal to from, may be greater than original.length, in which case 0L is placed in all elements of the copy whose index is greater than or equal to original.length - from. The length of the returned array will be to - from.

"Given the value of an attribute ,  returns a string escaped according to the rules specified in RFC 2253 .  For example ,  if the val is ""Sue ,  Grabbit and Runn"" ,  the escaped value returned by this method is ""Sue\ ,  Grabbit and Runn"" .  A string value is represented as a String and binary value as a byte array . "
"Returns whether Toolkit supports this state for Frames .  This method tells whether the UI concept of ,  say ,  maximization or iconification is supported .  It will always return false for ""compound"" states like Frame . ICONIFIED|Frame . MAXIMIZED _ VERT .  In other words ,  the rule of thumb is that only queries with a single frame state constant as an argument are meaningful .  Note that supporting a given concept is a platform -  dependent feature .  Due to native limitations the Toolkit object may report a particular state as supported ,  however at the same time the Toolkit object will be unable to apply the state to a given frame .  This circumstance has two following consequences: Only the return value of false for the present method actually indicates that the given state is not supported .  If the method returns true the given state may still be unsupported and/or unavailable for a particular frame .  The developer should consider examining the value of the WindowEvent . getNewState ( ) method of the WindowEvent received through the WindowStateListener ,  rather than assuming that the state given to the setExtendedState ( ) method will be definitely applied .  For more information see the documentation for the Frame . setExtendedState ( int) method . "

Returns the abstract pathname of this abstract pathname's parent ,  or null if this pathname does not name a parent directory .  The parent of an abstract pathname consists of the pathname's prefix ,  if any ,  and each name in the pathname's name sequence except for the last .  If the name sequence is empty then the pathname does not name a parent directory . 
Acquires in exclusive mode ,  aborting if interrupted .  Implemented by first checking interrupt status ,  then invoking at least once tryAcquire ( long) ,  returning on success .  Otherwise the thread is queued ,  possibly repeatedly blocking and unblocking ,  invoking tryAcquire ( long) until success or the thread is interrupted .  This method can be used to implement method Lock . lockInterruptibly ( ) . 
Returns an int that ORs together the values for all the ranges that will be shaped. For example ,  to check if a shaper shapes to Arabic ,  you would use the following: if ((shaper.getRanges( )  & shaper.ARABIC )  != 0 )  &#123; ... Note that this method supports only the bit mask - based ranges. Call getRangeSet( )  for the enum - based ranges.

Returns the formatting mask . 
If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped to null ) , attempts to compute its value using the given mapping function and enters it into this map unless null. If the function returns null no mapping is recorded. If the function itself throws an (unchecked )  exception, the exception is rethrown, and no mapping is recorded. The most common usage is to construct a new object serving as an initial mapped value or memoized result, as in: map.computeIfAbsent(key, k - >  new Value(f(k )  )  ) ; Or to implement a multi-value map, Map < K,Collection < V >  > , supporting multiple values per key: map.computeIfAbsent(key, k - >  new HashSet < V > ( )  ) .add(v ) ;

Constructs a BatchUpdateException object initialized with a given cause and updateCounts. The SQLState is initialized to null and the vendor code is initialized to 0. The reason is initialized to null if cause==null or to cause.toString ( ) if cause!=null. Note: There is no validation of updateCounts for overflow and because of this it is recommended that you use the constructor BatchUpdateException ( String reason ,  String SQLState ,  int vendorCode ,  long [ ] updateCounts , Throwable cause) .
"Sets the caret visibility ,  and repaints the caret .  It is important to understand the relationship between this method ,  isVisible and isActive .  Calling this method with a value of true activates the caret blinking .  Setting it to false turns it completely off .  To determine whether the blinking is active ,  you should call isActive .  In effect ,  isActive is an appropriate corresponding ""getter"" method for this one .  isVisible can be used to fetch the current visibility status of the caret ,  meaning whether or not it is currently painted .  This status will change as the caret blinks on and off .  Here's a list showing the potential return values of both isActive and isVisible after calling this method: setVisible ( true): isActive ( ): true isVisible ( ): true or false depending on whether or not the caret is blinked on or off setVisible ( false): isActive ( ): false isVisible ( ): false"
Applies the given pattern string to this date format . 
Disables the current thread for thread scheduling purposes ,  for up to the specified waiting time ,  unless the permit is available .  If the permit is available then it is consumed and the call returns immediately; otherwise the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four things happens: Some other thread invokes unpark with the current thread as the target; or Some other thread interrupts the current thread; or The specified waiting time elapses; or The call spuriously (that is ,  for no reason )  returns .  This method does not report which of these caused the method to return .  Callers should re - check the conditions which caused the thread to park in the first place .  Callers may also determine ,  for example ,  the interrupt status of the thread ,  or the elapsed time upon return . 
Determines whether or not the tokenizer recognizes C++ - style comments .  If the flag argument is true ,  this stream tokenizer recognizes C++ - style comments .  Any occurrence of two consecutive slash characters ('/' )  is treated as the beginning of a comment that extends to the end of the line .  If the flag argument is false ,  then C++ - style comments are not treated specially .

Returns whether the drawing buffer was recently restored from a lost state and reinitialized to the default background color (white ) . Since the buffers in a buffer strategy are usually type VolatileImage ,  they may become lost. If a surface has been recently restored from a lost state since the last call to getDrawGraphics ,  it may require repainting. For a discussion on lost buffers ,  see VolatileImage.
This default implementation does no painting . 
Tells if the popup is visible or not . 
"Add a service. If a service of the same type with the same algorithm name exists and it was added using putService( ) , it is replaced by the new service. This method also places information about this service in the provider's Hashtable values in the format described in the Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification & Reference . Also, if there is a security manager, its checkSecurityAccess method is called with the string ""putProviderProperty.""+name, where name is the provider name, to see if it's ok to set this provider's property values. If the default implementation of checkSecurityAccess is used (that is, that method is not overriden ) , then this results in a call to the security manager's checkPermission method with a SecurityPermission(""putProviderProperty.""+name )  permission."
Returns the previous - or - same day - of - week adjuster ,  which adjusts the date to the first occurrence of the specified day - of - week before the date being adjusted unless it is already on that day in which case the same object is returned. The ISO calendar system behaves as follows: The input 2011 - 01 - 15 (a Saturday )  for parameter (MONDAY )  will return 2011 - 01 - 10 (five days earlier ) . The input 2011 - 01 - 15 (a Saturday )  for parameter (WEDNESDAY )  will return 2011 - 01 - 12 (three days earlier ) . The input 2011 - 01 - 15 (a Saturday )  for parameter (SATURDAY )  will return 2011 - 01 - 15 (same as input ) . The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems. It uses the DAY _ OF _ WEEK field and the DAYS unit ,  and assumes a seven day week.
Sets the properties on this button to match those in the specified Action .  Refer to Swing Components Supporting Action for more details as to which properties this sets . 
Passes along the properties from the source object after adding a property indicating the cropped region .  This method invokes super . setProperties ,  which might result in additional properties being added .  Note: This method is intended to be called by the ImageProducer of the Image whose pixels are being filtered .  Developers using this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling this method directly since that operation could interfere with the filtering operation . 
Creates a new input stream for reading archives created by the XMLEncoder class . 
Removes a specified value from the attribute. If attrval is not in the attribute ,  this method does nothing. If the attribute values are ordered ,  the first occurrence of attrVal is removed and attribute values at indices greater than the removed value are shifted up towards the head of the list (and their indices decremented by one ) . Equality is determined by the implementation ,  which may use Object.equals( )  or schema information to determine equality.
Returns the baseline .  The baseline is measured from the top of the component .  This method is primarily meant for LayoutManagers to align components along their baseline .  A return value less than 0 indicates this component does not have a reasonable baseline and that LayoutManagers should not align this component on its baseline .  This method returns -1 .  Subclasses that have a meaningful baseline should override appropriately .

Creates a new int buffer that shares this buffer's content .  The content of the new buffer will be that of this buffer .  Changes to this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer ,  and vice versa; the two buffers' position ,  limit ,  and mark values will be independent .  The new buffer's capacity ,  limit ,  position ,  and mark values will be identical to those of this buffer .  The new buffer will be direct if ,  and only if ,  this buffer is direct ,  and it will be read - only if ,  and only if ,  this buffer is read - only .

Flushes the stream . 
Returns the red color component for the specified pixel ,  scaled from 0 to 255 in the default RGB ColorSpace ,  sRGB .  A color conversion is done if necessary .  The pixel value is specified by an array of data elements of type transferType passed in as an object reference .  The returned value is a non pre - multiplied value .  For example ,  if alpha is premultiplied ,  this method divides it out before returning the value .  If the alpha value is 0 ,  the red value is 0 .  If inData is not a primitive array of type transferType ,  a ClassCastException is thrown .  An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown if inData is not large enough to hold a pixel value for this ColorModel .  If this transferType is not supported ,  a UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown .  Since ColorModel is an abstract class ,  any instance must be an instance of a subclass .  Subclasses inherit the implementation of this method and if they don't override it ,  this method throws an exception if the subclass uses a transferType other than DataBuffer . TYPE _ BYTE ,  DataBuffer . TYPE _ USHORT ,  or DataBuffer . TYPE _ INT . 
Overridden to avoid propagating a invalidate up the tree when the cell renderer child is configured .

Creates a Spliterator.OfInt covering a range of elements of a given array ,  using a customized set of spliterator characteristics. This method is provided as an implementation convenience for Spliterators which store portions of their elements in arrays ,  and need fine control over Spliterator characteristics. Most other situations in which a Spliterator for an array is needed should use Arrays.spliterator ( int [ ] ,  int ,  int ) . The returned spliterator always reports the characteristics SIZED and SUBSIZED. The caller may provide additional characteristics for the spliterator to report; it is common to additionally specify IMMUTABLE and ORDERED.
Makes a copy of the attributes . 
Returns the offset within this buffer's backing array of the first element of the buffer (optional operation ) . If this buffer is backed by an array then buffer position p corresponds to array index p + arrayOffset( ) . Invoke the hasArray method before invoking this method in order to ensure that this buffer has an accessible backing array.
Returns the preferred size of the viewport for a view component .  If the view component of this layer implements Scrollable ,  this method delegates its implementation to the view component . 
Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname that satisfy the specified filter .  The behavior of this method is the same as that of the listFiles ( ) method ,  except that the pathnames in the returned array must satisfy the filter .  If the given filter is null then all pathnames are accepted .  Otherwise ,  a pathname satisfies the filter if and only if the value true results when the FileFilter . accept ( File) method of the filter is invoked on the pathname . 
"Constant for the ""Private Use Area"" Unicode character block . "

Returns the amount of space taken up by a border drawn by drawEtchedRect ( )
Retrieves the number of values in this attribute . 
Adds a listener to a registered MBean .  A notification emitted by an MBean will be forwarded by the MBeanServer to the listener .  If the source of the notification is a reference to an MBean object ,  the MBean server will replace it by that MBean's ObjectName .  Otherwise the source is unchanged .  The listener object that receives notifications is the one that is registered with the given name at the time this method is called .  Even if it is subsequently unregistered ,  it will continue to receive notifications . 
Returns a copy of this time with the specified amount subtracted. This returns an OffsetTime ,  based on this one ,  with the specified amount subtracted. The amount is typically Duration but may be any other type implementing the TemporalAmount interface. The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling TemporalAmount.subtractFrom ( Temporal ) . The amount implementation is free to implement the subtraction in any way it wishes ,  however it typically calls back to minus ( long ,  TemporalUnit ) . Consult the documentation of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully subtracted. This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Set a new text for scanning .  The current scan position is reset to first ( ) .

"Creates a SaslServer for the specified mechanism .  This method uses the JCA Security Provider Framework ,  described in the ""Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification & Reference"" ,  for locating and selecting a SaslServer implementation .  First ,  it obtains an ordered list of SaslServerFactory instances from the registered security providers for the ""SaslServerFactory"" service and the specified mechanism .  It then invokes createSaslServer ( ) on each factory instance on the list until one produces a non - null SaslServer instance .  It returns the non - null SaslServer instance ,  or null if the search fails to produce a non - null SaslServer instance .  A security provider for SaslServerFactory registers with the JCA Security Provider Framework keys of the form SaslServerFactory . mechanism _ name and values that are class names of implementations of javax . security . sasl . SaslServerFactory .  For example ,  a provider that contains a factory class ,  com . wiz . sasl . digest . ServerFactory ,  that supports the ""DIGEST - MD5"" mechanism would register the following entry with the JCA: SaslServerFactory . DIGEST - MD5 com . wiz . sasl . digest . ServerFactory See the ""Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification & Reference"" for information about how to install and configure security service providers . "
Returns an array indicating the notifications that this MBean sends .  The implementation in JMXConnectorServer returns an array with one element ,  indicating that it can emit notifications of class JMXConnectionNotification with the types defined in that class .

Moves the specified component to the specified z - order index in the container .  The z - order determines the order that components are painted; the component with the highest z - order paints first and the component with the lowest z - order paints last .  Where components overlap ,  the component with the lower z - order paints over the component with the higher z - order .  If the component is a child of some other container ,  it is removed from that container before being added to this container .  The important difference between this method and java . awt . Container . add ( Component ,  int )  is that this method doesn't call removeNotify on the component while removing it from its previous container unless necessary and when allowed by the underlying native windowing system .  This way ,  if the component has the keyboard focus ,  it maintains the focus when moved to the new position .  This property is guaranteed to apply only to lightweight non - Container components .  This method changes layout - related information ,  and therefore ,  invalidates the component hierarchy .  Note: Not all platforms support changing the z - order of heavyweight components from one container into another without the call to removeNotify .  There is no way to detect whether a platform supports this ,  so developers shouldn't make any assumptions .

Obtains a ChronoZonedDateTime in this chronology from another temporal object .  This obtains a zoned date - time in this chronology based on the specified temporal .  A TemporalAccessor represents an arbitrary set of date and time information ,  which this factory converts to an instance of ChronoZonedDateTime .  The conversion will first obtain a ZoneId from the temporal object ,  falling back to a ZoneOffset if necessary .  It will then try to obtain an Instant ,  falling back to a ChronoLocalDateTime if necessary .  The result will be either the combination of ZoneId or ZoneOffset with Instant or ChronoLocalDateTime .  Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects .  The result uses this chronology .  This method matches the signature of the functional interface TemporalQuery allowing it to be used as a query via method reference ,  aChronology::zonedDateTime .

Closes the client connection to its server .  Any ongoing or new request using the MBeanServerConnection returned by JMXConnector . getMBeanServerConnection ( ) will get an IOException .  If close has already been called successfully on this object ,  calling it again has no effect .  If close has never been called ,  or if it was called but produced an exception ,  an attempt will be made to close the connection .  This attempt can succeed ,  in which case close will return normally ,  or it can generate an exception .  Closing a connection is a potentially slow operation .  For example ,  if the server has crashed ,  the close operation might have to wait for a network protocol timeout .  Callers that do not want to block in a close operation should do it in a separate thread .

Installs the DefaultFormatter onto a particular JFormattedTextField .  This will invoke valueToString to convert the current value from the JFormattedTextField to a String .  This will then install the Actions from getActions ,  the DocumentFilter returned from getDocumentFilter and the NavigationFilter returned from getNavigationFilter onto the JFormattedTextField .  Subclasses will typically only need to override this if they wish to install additional listeners on the JFormattedTextField .  If there is a ParseException in converting the current value to a String ,  this will set the text to an empty String ,  and mark the JFormattedTextField as being in an invalid state .  While this is a public method ,  this is typically only useful for subclassers of JFormattedTextField .  JFormattedTextField will invoke this method at the appropriate times when the value changes ,  or its internal state changes .

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array. If the set fits in the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this set. If this set fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e., the array has more elements than this set ) , the element in the array immediately following the end of the set is set to null. (This is useful in determining the length of this set only if the caller knows that this set does not contain any null elements. )  If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in the same order. Like the toArray( )  method, this method acts as bridge between array - based and collection - based APIs. Further, this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may, under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs. Suppose x is a set known to contain only strings. The following code can be used to dump the set into a newly allocated array of String: String [ ] y = x.toArray(new String [ 0] ) ; Note that toArray(new Object [ 0] )  is identical in function to toArray( ) .
Returns a resource bundle using the specified base name ,  the default locale and the specified control .  Calling this method is equivalent to calling getBundle ( baseName ,  Locale . getDefault ( ) ,  this . getClass ( ) . getClassLoader ( ) ,  control) ,  except that getClassLoader ( ) is run with the security privileges of ResourceBundle .  See getBundle for the complete description of the resource bundle loading process with a ResourceBundle . Control . 
Specifies the attributes that will be returned as part of the search .  null indicates that all attributes will be returned .  An empty array indicates no attributes are returned . 
Flips to the previous card of the specified container .  If the currently visible card is the first one ,  this method flips to the last card in the layout . 
Returns an array of Strings containing the names of additional document formats ,  other than the native and standard formats ,  recognized by the getAsTree and setFromTree methods on the stream metadata objects produced or consumed by this plug - in .  If the plug - in does not handle metadata ,  null should be returned .  The set of formats may differ according to the particular images being read or written; this method should indicate all the additional formats supported by the plug - in under any circumstances .  The default implementation returns a clone of the extraStreamMetadataFormatNames instance variable ,  which is typically set by the constructor . 
Extracts the reference to a CORBA Object from this DynAny . 
Replaces an Object in the list of parameters with a Short .  If the index lies beyond the current source list ,  the list is extended with nulls as needed . 
Returns a new PermissionCollection object for storing SocketPermission objects .  SocketPermission objects must be stored in a manner that allows them to be inserted into the collection in any order ,  but that also enables the PermissionCollection implies method to be implemented in an efficient (and consistent )  manner . 
Returns a string representation of the integer argument as an unsigned integer in base 2. The unsigned integer value is the argument plus 232 if the argument is negative; otherwise it is equal to the argument. This value is converted to a string of ASCII digits in binary (base 2 )  with no extra leading 0s. The value of the argument can be recovered from the returned string s by calling Integer.parseUnsignedInt(s ,  2 ) . If the unsigned magnitude is zero ,  it is represented by a single zero character '0' ('\u0030' ) ; otherwise ,  the first character of the representation of the unsigned magnitude will not be the zero character. The characters '0' ('\u0030' )  and '1' ('\u0031' )  are used as binary digits.

Gets the Tree node for an AnnotationValue for an AnnotationMirror on a given Element .  Returns null if the node can not be found . 
Obtains a HijrahDate of the Islamic Umm Al - Qura calendar from a temporal object .  This obtains a date in the Hijrah calendar system based on the specified temporal .  A TemporalAccessor represents an arbitrary set of date and time information ,  which this factory converts to an instance of HijrahDate .  The conversion typically uses the EPOCH _ DAY field ,  which is standardized across calendar systems .  This method matches the signature of the functional interface TemporalQuery allowing it to be used as a query via method reference ,  HijrahDate::from . 
Tests whether an action is supported on the current platform .  Even when the platform supports an action ,  a file or URI may not have a registered application for the action .  For example ,  most of the platforms support the Desktop . Action . OPEN action .  But for a specific file ,  there may not be an application registered to open it .  In this case ,  isSupported ( java . awt . Desktop . Action )  may return true ,  but the corresponding action method will throw an IOException . 
Returns the TypeCode associated with this DynAny object .  A DynAny object is created with a TypeCode value assigned to it .

Returns a reverse order view of the mappings contained in this map .  The descending map is backed by this map ,  so changes to the map are reflected in the descending map ,  and vice - versa .  The returned map has an ordering equivalent to Collections . reverseOrder ( comparator ( )) .  The expression m . descendingMap ( ) . descendingMap ( ) returns a view of m essentially equivalent to m . 
Handles caret updates (fire appropriate property change event ,  which are AccessibleContext.ACCESSIBLE _ CARET _ PROPERTY and AccessibleContext.ACCESSIBLE _ SELECTION _ PROPERTY ) .

"Creates a stream socket and connects it to the specified port number on the named host. If the specified host is null it is the equivalent of specifying the address as InetAddress.getByName ( null ) . In other words ,  it is equivalent to specifying an address of the loopback interface. If the stream argument is true ,  this creates a stream socket. If the stream argument is false ,  it creates a datagram socket. If the application has specified a server socket factory ,  that factory's createSocketImpl method is called to create the actual socket implementation. Otherwise a ""plain"" socket is created. If there is a security manager ,  its checkConnect method is called with the host address and port as its arguments. This could result in a SecurityException. If a UDP socket is used ,  TCP/IP related socket options will not apply."

The new context has the same environment properties and connection request controls as this context .  See the class description for details .  Implementations might also allow this context and the new context to share the same network connection or other resources if doing so does not impede the independence of either context . 
The VM option was set via an environment variable . 
Returns true if this writer supports compression . 
Returns the output stream connected to the normal input of the subprocess .  Output to the stream is piped into the standard input of the process represented by this Process object .  If the standard input of the subprocess has been redirected using ProcessBuilder . redirectInput then this method will return a null output stream .  Implementation note: It is a good idea for the returned output stream to be buffered . 
The static instance of DefinitionKind indicating that an Interface Repository object is a constant . 
Creates a FileInputStream by using the file descriptor fdObj ,  which represents an existing connection to an actual file in the file system .  If there is a security manager ,  its checkRead method is called with the file descriptor fdObj as its argument to see if it's ok to read the file descriptor .  If read access is denied to the file descriptor a SecurityException is thrown .  If fdObj is null then a NullPointerException is thrown .  This constructor does not throw an exception if fdObj is invalid .  However ,  if the methods are invoked on the resulting stream to attempt I/O on the stream ,  an IOException is thrown . 
Returns the difference in milliseconds between local time and UTC ,  taking into account both the raw offset and the effect of daylight saving ,  for the specified date and time .  This method assumes that the start and end month are distinct .  It also uses a default GregorianCalendar object as its underlying calendar ,  such as for determining leap years .  Do not use the result of this method with a calendar other than a default GregorianCalendar .  Note: In general ,  clients should use Calendar . get ( ZONE _ OFFSET )  + Calendar . get ( DST _ OFFSET )  instead of calling this method . 
"Specifies that the character argument is ""ordinary"" in this tokenizer .  It removes any special significance the character has as a comment character ,  word component ,  string delimiter ,  white space ,  or number character .  When such a character is encountered by the parser ,  the parser treats it as a single - character token and sets ttype field to the character value .  Making a line terminator character ""ordinary"" may interfere with the ability of a StreamTokenizer to count lines .  The lineno method may no longer reflect the presence of such terminator characters in its line count . "

Produces a method handle giving write access to a reflected field .  The type of the method handle will have a void return type .  If the field is static ,  the method handle will take a single argument ,  of the field's value type ,  the value to be stored .  Otherwise ,  the two arguments will be the instance containing the field ,  and the value to be stored .  If the field's accessible flag is not set ,  access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class .  If the field is static ,  and if the returned method handle is invoked ,  the field's class will be initialized ,  if it has not already been initialized .

Determines whether this bean needs a GUI . 
"When a filter is provided ,  the implementation will call out to the filter as it is constructing the DOM tree structure .  The filter can choose to remove elements from the document being constructed ,  or to terminate the parsing early .  The filter is invoked after the operations requested by the DOMConfiguration parameters have been applied .  For example ,  if "" validate"" is set to true ,  the validation is done before invoking the filter . "
Sets the designated parameter to the given Java double value .  The driver converts this to an SQL DOUBLE value when it sends it to the database . 
Returns a proxy class that implements the interfaces named in a proxy class descriptor; subclasses may implement this method to read custom data from the stream along with the descriptors for dynamic proxy classes ,  allowing them to use an alternate loading mechanism for the interfaces and the proxy class. This method is called exactly once for each unique proxy class descriptor in the stream. The corresponding method in ObjectOutputStream is annotateProxyClass. For a given subclass of ObjectInputStream that overrides this method ,  the annotateProxyClass method in the corresponding subclass of ObjectOutputStream must write any data or objects read by this method. The default implementation of this method in ObjectInputStream returns the result of calling Proxy.getProxyClass with the list of Class objects for the interfaces that are named in the interfaces parameter. The Class object for each interface name i is the value returned by calling Class.forName(i ,  false ,  loader )  where loader is that of the first non - null class loader up the execution stack ,  or null if no non - null class loaders are on the stack (the same class loader choice used by the resolveClass method ) . Unless any of the resolved interfaces are non - public ,  this same value of loader is also the class loader passed to Proxy.getProxyClass; if non - public interfaces are present ,  their class loader is passed instead (if more than one non - public interface class loader is encountered ,  an IllegalAccessError is thrown ) . If Proxy.getProxyClass throws an IllegalArgumentException ,  resolveProxyClass will throw a ClassNotFoundException containing the IllegalArgumentException.

The schema specifies what types of objects can be added to the directory and where they can be added; what mandatory and optional attributes an object can have .  The range of support for schemas is directory - specific .  This method returns the root of the schema information tree that is applicable to the named object .  Several named objects (or even an entire directory )  might share the same schema .  Issues such as structure and contents of the schema tree ,  permission to modify to the contents of the schema tree ,  and the effect of such modifications on the directory are dependent on the underlying directory .

Returns a string representing the state of this Container .  This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes ,  and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations .  The returned string may be empty but may not be null . 
Repositions this stream to the position at the time the mark method was last called on this input stream .  This method simply performs in . reset ( ) .  Stream marks are intended to be used in situations where you need to read ahead a little to see what's in the stream .  Often this is most easily done by invoking some general parser .  If the stream is of the type handled by the parse ,  it just chugs along happily .  If the stream is not of that type ,  the parser should toss an exception when it fails .  If this happens within readlimit bytes ,  it allows the outer code to reset the stream and try another parser .

Acquires the lock only if it is free at the time of invocation. Acquires the lock if it is available and returns immediately with the value true. If the lock is not available then this method will return immediately with the value false. A typical usage idiom for this method would be: Lock lock = ...; if (lock.tryLock( )  )  { try { // manipulate protected state } finally { lock.unlock( ) ; } } else { // perform alternative actions } This usage ensures that the lock is unlocked if it was acquired ,  and doesn't try to unlock if the lock was not acquired.

Checks if this date is after the specified date .  This checks to see if this date represents a point on the local time - line after the other date .  LocalDate a = LocalDate . of ( 2012 ,  6 ,  30); LocalDate b = LocalDate . of ( 2012 ,  7 ,  1); a . isAfter ( b) == false a . isAfter ( a) == false b . isAfter ( a) == true This method only considers the position of the two dates on the local time - line .  It does not take into account the chronology ,  or calendar system .  This is different from the comparison in compareTo ( ChronoLocalDate) ,  but is the same approach as ChronoLocalDate . timeLineOrder ( ) . 
Returns the hash code which corresponds to the string for this tag . 
Tests if this path ends with the given path .  If the given path has N elements ,  and no root component ,  and this path has N or more elements ,  then this path ends with the given path if the last N elements of each path ,  starting at the element farthest from the root ,  are equal .  If the given path has a root component then this path ends with the given path if the root component of this path ends with the root component of the given path ,  and the corresponding elements of both paths are equal .  Whether or not the root component of this path ends with the root component of the given path is file system specific .  If this path does not have a root component and the given path has a root component then this path does not end with the given path .  If the given path is associated with a different FileSystem to this path then false is returned .

Returns the advance width of the specified character in this Font .  The advance is the distance from the leftmost point to the rightmost point on the character's baseline .  Note that the advance of a String is not necessarily the sum of the advances of its characters .  This method doesn't validate the specified character to be a valid Unicode code point .  The caller must validate the character value using Character . isValidCodePoint if necessary . 
Tests if the interior of the Shape intersects the interior of a specified rectangular area .  The rectangular area is considered to intersect the Shape if any point is contained in both the interior of the Shape and the specified rectangular area .  The Shape . intersects ( ) method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return true when: there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the Shape intersect ,  but the calculations to accurately determine this intersection are prohibitively expensive .  This means that for some Shapes this method might return true even though the rectangular area does not intersect the Shape .  The Area class performs more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required .  This method object may conservatively return true in cases where the specified rectangular area intersects a segment of the path ,  but that segment does not represent a boundary between the interior and exterior of the path .  Such a case may occur if some set of segments of the path are retraced in the reverse direction such that the two sets of segments cancel each other out without any interior area between them .  To determine whether segments represent true boundaries of the interior of the path would require extensive calculations involving all of the segments of the path and the winding rule and are thus beyond the scope of this implementation .

"Converts the given URI to a Path object. This method iterates over the installed providers to locate the provider that is identified by the URI scheme of the given URI. URI schemes are compared without regard to case. If the provider is found then its getPath method is invoked to convert the URI. In the case of the default provider ,  identified by the URI scheme ""file"" ,  the given URI has a non - empty path component ,  and undefined query and fragment components. Whether the authority component may be present is platform specific. The returned Path is associated with the default file system. The default provider provides a similar round - trip guarantee to the File class. For a given Path p it is guaranteed that Paths.get(p.toUri( )  ) .equals( p.toAbsolutePath( )  )  so long as the original Path ,  the URI ,  and the new Path are all created in (possibly different invocations of )  the same Java virtual machine. Whether other providers make any guarantees is provider specific and therefore unspecified."

Inserts a menu item for the specified Action object at a given position . 
Returns the index within this string of the last occurrence of the specified substring .  The integer returned is the largest value k such that: k <= Math . min ( fromIndex ,  this . length ( )) && this . toString ( ) . startsWith ( str ,  k) If no such value of k exists ,  then -1 is returned . 
Reinitialize the insets parameter with this Border's current Insets . 
Returns the hash code value for this map .  The hash code of a map is defined to be the sum of the hash codes of each entry in the map's entrySet ( ) view .  This ensures that m1 . equals ( m2) implies that m1 . hashCode ( )==m2 . hashCode ( ) for any two maps m1 and m2 ,  as required by the general contract of Object . hashCode ( ) . 
Creates and returns an Action used to play a sound .  If key is non - null ,  an Action is created using the value from the defaults with key key .  The value identifies the sound resource to load when actionPerformed is invoked on the Action .  The sound resource is loaded into a byte [ ] by way of getClass ( ) . getResourceAsStream ( ) . 
Get the state set of this object . 
Searches in a single context for objects that contain a specified set of attributes ,  and retrieves selected attributes .  See DirContext . search ( Name ,  Attributes ,  String [ ] )  for details . 
Creates a dialog with the specified title ,  owner Frame and modality .  If owner is null ,  a shared ,  hidden frame will be set as the owner of this dialog .  This constructor sets the component's locale property to the value returned by JComponent . getDefaultLocale .  NOTE: Any popup components (JComboBox ,  JPopupMenu ,  JMenuBar )  created within a modal dialog will be forced to be lightweight .  NOTE: This constructor does not allow you to create an unowned JDialog .  To create an unowned JDialog you must use either the JDialog(Window )  or JDialog(Dialog )  constructor with an argument of null .

Compares two ObjectName instances .  The ordering relation between ObjectNames is not completely specified but is intended to be such that a sorted list of ObjectNames will appear in an order that is convenient for a person to read .  In particular ,  if the two ObjectName instances have different domains then their order is the lexicographical order of the domains .  The ordering of the key property list remains unspecified .  For example ,  the ObjectName instances below: Shapes:type=Square , name=3 Colors:type=Red , name=2 Shapes:type=Triangle , side=isosceles , name=2 Colors:type=Red , name=1 Shapes:type=Square , name=1 Colors:type=Blue , name=1 Shapes:type=Square , name=2 JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate Shapes:type=Triangle , side=scalene , name=1 could be ordered as follows: Colors:type=Blue , name=1 Colors:type=Red , name=1 Colors:type=Red , name=2 JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate Shapes:type=Square , name=1 Shapes:type=Square , name=2 Shapes:type=Square , name=3 Shapes:type=Triangle , side=scalene , name=1 Shapes:type=Triangle , side=isosceles , name=2
Set the value to be associated with the given name ,  replacing any previous association . 
Configures the specified component appropriately for the look and feel .  This method is invoked when the ComponentUI instance is being installed as the UI delegate on the specified component .  This method should completely configure the component for the look and feel ,  including the following: Install default property values for color ,  fonts ,  borders ,  icons ,  opacity ,  etc .  on the component .  Whenever possible ,  property values initialized by the client program should not be overridden .  Install a LayoutManager on the component if necessary .  Create/add any required sub - components to the component .  Create/install event listeners on the component .  Create/install a PropertyChangeListener on the component in order to detect and respond to component property changes appropriately .  Install keyboard UI (mnemonics ,  traversal ,  etc .  )  on the component .  Initialize any appropriate instance data . 
Returns the bank indices for all bands . 
Returns the number of components of a DynAny .  For a DynAny without components ,  it returns zero .  The operation only counts the components at the top level .  For example ,  if component _ count is invoked on a DynStruct with a single member ,  the return value is 1 ,  irrespective of the type of the member .  For sequences ,  the operation returns the current number of elements .  For structures ,  exceptions ,  and value types ,  the operation returns the number of members .  For arrays ,  the operation returns the number of elements .  For unions ,  the operation returns 2 if the discriminator indicates that a named member is active ,  otherwise ,  it returns 1 .  For DynFixed and DynEnum ,  the operation returns zero . 
Denotes a UI which performs the normal end user role . 
Updates the designated column with a binary stream value ,  which will have the specified number of bytes .  The updater methods are used to update column values in the current row or the insert row .  The updater methods do not update the underlying database; instead the updateRow or insertRow methods are called to update the database . 
Returns a string representation of the first argument as an unsigned integer value in the radix specified by the second argument .  If the radix is smaller than Character . MIN _ RADIX or larger than Character . MAX _ RADIX ,  then the radix 10 is used instead .  Note that since the first argument is treated as an unsigned value ,  no leading sign character is printed .  If the magnitude is zero ,  it is represented by a single zero character '0' ('\u0030' ) ; otherwise ,  the first character of the representation of the magnitude will not be the zero character .  The behavior of radixes and the characters used as digits are the same as toString . 
Extracts the long value from this DynAny .  The IDL unsigned long long data type is mapped to the Java long data type . 
Sets the properties on this textfield to match those in the specified Action .  Refer to Swing Components Supporting Action for more details as to which properties this sets .

Obtains a ChronoZonedDateTime in this chronology from an Instant .  This obtains a zoned date - time with the same instant as that specified . 
Returns the greater of two double values .  That is ,  the result is the argument closer to positive infinity .  If the arguments have the same value ,  the result is that same value .  If either value is NaN ,  then the result is NaN .  Unlike the numerical comparison operators ,  this method considers negative zero to be strictly smaller than positive zero .  If one argument is positive zero and the other negative zero ,  the result is positive zero . 
The user has activated the line up area of a scroll bar .

For each path identifies if that path is in fact new . 
Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period added .  This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period added .  For example ,  on a LocalDate ,  this could be used to add a number of years ,  months or days .  The returned object will have the same observable type as this object .  In some cases ,  changing a field is not fully defined .  For example ,  if the target object is a date representing the 31st January ,  then adding one month would be unclear .  In cases like this ,  the field is responsible for resolving the result .  Typically it will choose the previous valid date ,  which would be the last valid day of February in this example . 
Performs the given action for each entry in this map until all entries have been processed or the action throws an exception .  Unless otherwise specified by the implementing class ,  actions are performed in the order of entry set iteration (if an iteration order is specified .  )  Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the caller . 
Construct a DateFormatSymbols object by loading format data from resources for the default FORMAT locale. This constructor can only construct instances for the locales supported by the Java runtime environment ,  not for those supported by installed DateFormatSymbolsProvider implementations. For full locale coverage ,  use the getInstance method. This is equivalent to calling DateFormatSymbols ( Locale.getDefault ( Locale.Category.FORMAT )  ) .
Attribute key for input method underlines .  Values are instances of Integer .  The default value is -1 ,  which means no underline .  Several constant values are provided ,  see UNDERLINE _ LOW _ ONE _ PIXEL ,  UNDERLINE _ LOW _ TWO _ PIXEL ,  UNDERLINE _ LOW _ DOTTED ,  UNDERLINE _ LOW _ GRAY ,  and UNDERLINE _ LOW _ DASHED .  This may be used in conjunction with UNDERLINE if desired .  The primary purpose is for use by input methods .  Other use of these underlines for simple ornamentation might confuse users .  The input method underline affects both the visual bounds and the outline of the text .

Converts the string argument into a long value . 
Returns the window title foreground color of the current theme .  This is a cover method for getCurrentTheme ( ) . getWindowTitleForeground ( ) . 
Receive notification of the beginning of an element. The Parser will invoke this method at the beginning of every element in the XML document; there will be a corresponding endElement event for every startElement event (even when the element is empty ) . All of the element's content will be reported, in order, before the corresponding endElement event. This event allows up to three name components for each element: the Namespace URI; the local name; and the qualified (prefixed )  name. Any or all of these may be provided, depending on the values of the http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces and the http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace - prefixes properties: the Namespace URI and local name are required when the namespaces property is true (the default ) , and are optional when the namespaces property is false (if one is specified, both must be ) ; the qualified name is required when the namespace - prefixes property is true, and is optional when the namespace - prefixes property is false (the default ) . Note that the attribute list provided will contain only attributes with explicit values (specified or defaulted ) : #IMPLIED attributes will be omitted. The attribute list will contain attributes used for Namespace declarations (xmlns* attributes )  only if the http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace - prefixes property is true (it is false by default, and support for a true value is optional ) . Like characters( ) , attribute values may have characters that need more than one char value.
Sets the base URI . 
Creates a new named style . 
Convert the point (x , y )  in source coordinate system to destination coordinate system .  If source is null ,  (x , y )  is assumed to be in destination's root component coordinate system .  If destination is null ,  (x , y )  will be converted to source's root component coordinate system .  If both source and destination are null ,  return (x , y )  without any conversion . 
Returns the TCKind associated with the member of this union . 
Uninitializes the look and feel .  While this method is public ,  it should only be invoked by the UIManager when the look and feel is uninstalled .  For example ,  UIManager . setLookAndFeel invokes this when the look and feel is changed .  Subclasses may choose to free up some resources here . 
Determines if the specified character is a letter .  A character is considered to be a letter if its general category type, provided by Character . getType ( ch ) , is any of the following: UPPERCASE _ LETTER LOWERCASE _ LETTER TITLECASE _ LETTER MODIFIER _ LETTER OTHER _ LETTER Not all letters have case .  Many characters are letters but are neither uppercase nor lowercase nor titlecase .  Note: This method cannot handle supplementary characters .  To support all Unicode characters, including supplementary characters, use the isLetter ( int )  method . 
Removes all of the elements of this collection that satisfy the given predicate .  Errors or runtime exceptions thrown during iteration or by the predicate are relayed to the caller . 
Returns the Object used as the value for the header renderer . 
Returns a copy of this date with the specified amount subtracted .  This returns a LocalDate ,  based on this one ,  with the amount in terms of the unit subtracted .  If it is not possible to subtract the amount ,  because the unit is not supported or for some other reason ,  an exception is thrown .  This method is equivalent to plus ( long ,  TemporalUnit )  with the amount negated .  See that method for a full description of how addition ,  and thus subtraction ,  works .  This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .

Returns this KeyboardFocusManager's KeyEventPostProcessor chain as a List .  The List will not include this KeyboardFocusManager unless it was explicitly added via a call to addKeyEventPostProcessor .  If no KeyEventPostProcessors are registered ,  implementations are free to return null or a List of length 0 .  Client code should not assume one behavior over another ,  nor should it assume that the behavior ,  once established ,  will not change . 
Log a message ,  specifying source class and method ,  with an array of object arguments .  If the logger is currently enabled for the given message level then a corresponding LogRecord is created and forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects .

Closes this socket. Any thread currently blocked in an I/O operation upon this socket will throw a SocketException. Once a socket has been closed ,  it is not available for further networking use (i.e. can't be reconnected or rebound ) . A new socket needs to be created. Closing this socket will also close the socket's InputStream and OutputStream. If this socket has an associated channel then the channel is closed as well.
Creates an SQLInputImpl object initialized with the given array of attributes and the given type map .  If any of the attributes is a UDT whose name is in an entry in the type map ,  the attribute will be mapped according to the corresponding SQLData implementation . 
Sets the foreground color of this object . 
Factory method for acquiring a single mechanism credential .  GSS - API mechanism providers must impose a local access - control policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring credentials to which they are not entitled .  The kinds of permissions needed by different mechanism providers will be documented on a per - mechanism basis .  A failed permission check might cause a SecurityException to be thrown from this method .  Non - default values for lifetime cannot always be honored by the underlying mechanisms ,  thus applications should be prepared to call getRemainingLifetime on the returned credential . 
Obtains an instance of ZoneOffset specifying the total offset in seconds The offset must be in the range -18:00 to +18:00 ,  which corresponds to -64800 to +64800 .

Returns an array containing a one - point size instance of all fonts available in this GraphicsEnvironment .  Typical usage would be to allow a user to select a particular font .  Then ,  the application can size the font and set various font attributes by calling the deriveFont method on the chosen instance .  This method provides for the application the most precise control over which Font instance is used to render text .  If a font in this GraphicsEnvironment has multiple programmable variations ,  only one instance of that Font is returned in the array ,  and other variations must be derived by the application .  If a font in this environment has multiple programmable variations ,  such as Multiple - Master fonts ,  only one instance of that font is returned in the Font array .  The other variations must be derived by the application . 
Returns the name of the missing enum constant . 
Given a point in local coordinates ,  return the zero-based index of the character under that Point .  If the point is invalid ,  this method returns -1 . 
Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in this vector, or -1 if this vector does not contain the element .  More formally, returns the lowest index i such that (o==null ? get(i ) ==null : o . equals(get(i )  )  ) , or -1 if there is no such index . 
Sets the margin between the menubar's border and its menus .  Setting to null will cause the menubar to use the default margins .

Gets the original type from the ErrorType object . 
Resets the UI property to a value from the current look and feel . 
Indicates whether this resource can be shared between this component and other components .  This may be specified for resources representing a connection factory of any supported type ,  and must not be specified for resources of other types . 
Returns true if this map contains no key - value mappings .  This result is a snapshot ,  and may not reflect unprocessed entries that will be removed before next attempted access because they are no longer referenced . 
The window - activated event type .  This event is delivered when the Window becomes the active Window .  Only a Frame or a Dialog can be the active Window .  The native windowing system may denote the active Window or its children with special decorations ,  such as a highlighted title bar .  The active Window is always either the focused Window ,  or the first Frame or Dialog that is an owner of the focused Window . 
Creates a shallow copy of a ParameterBlock .  The source and parameter Vectors are copied by reference -- additions or changes will be visible to both versions . 
A utility function to check if this event is a StartElement . 
Obtains the current year from the system clock in the specified time - zone .  This will query the system clock to obtain the current year .  Specifying the time - zone avoids dependence on the default time - zone .  Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing because the clock is hard - coded . 
If a remaining element exists ,  performs the given action on it ,  returning true; else returns false .  If this Spliterator is Spliterator . ORDERED the action is performed on the next element in encounter order .  Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the caller . 
"Indicates whether some other object is ""equal to"" this comparator. This method must obey the general contract of Object.equals ( Object ) . Additionally ,  this method can return true only if the specified object is also a comparator and it imposes the same ordering as this comparator. Thus ,  comp1.equals ( comp2 )  implies that sgn ( comp1.compare ( o1 ,  o2 )  ) ==sgn ( comp2.compare ( o1 ,  o2 )  )  for every object reference o1 and o2. Note that it is always safe not to override Object.equals ( Object ) . However ,  overriding this method may ,  in some cases ,  improve performance by allowing programs to determine that two distinct comparators impose the same order."
Inserts a byte value into the DynAny .  The IDL octet data type is mapped to the Java byte data type . 
Returns the indexth item in the map .  If index is greater than or equal to the number of nodes in this map ,  this returns null . 
Clears this reference object .  Invoking this method will not cause this object to be enqueued .  This method is invoked only by Java code; when the garbage collector clears references it does so directly ,  without invoking this method . 
Returns a Spliterator over the elements in this deque .  The returned spliterator is weakly consistent .  The Spliterator reports Spliterator . CONCURRENT ,  Spliterator . ORDERED ,  and Spliterator . NONNULL . 
Creates a DOMSignContext with the specified signing key and parent node .  The signing key is stored in a singleton KeySelector that is returned by the getKeySelector method .  The marshalled XMLSignature will be added as the last child element of the specified parent node unless a next sibling node is specified by invoking the setNextSibling method . 
Returns the number of visible rows . 
Returns a stream consisting of the distinct elements of this stream .  This is a stateful intermediate operation . 
An array of strings to be returned from getFileSuffixes ,  initially null . 
The key used for storing a Boolean that corresponds to the selected state .  This is typically used only for components that have a meaningful selection state .  For example ,  JRadioButton and JCheckBox make use of this but instances of JMenu don't .  This property differs from the others in that it is both read by the component and set by the component .  For example ,  if an Action is attached to a JCheckBox the selected state of the JCheckBox will be set from that of the Action .  If the user clicks on the JCheckBox the selected state of the JCheckBox and the Action will both be updated .  Note: the value of this field is prefixed with 'Swing' to avoid possible collisions with existing Actions . 
"Returns the font for the specified state .  This should NOT call any method on the JComponent .  Overridden to cause this style to populate itself with data from UIDefaults ,  if necessary .  If a value named ""font"" is not found in UIDefaults ,  then the ""defaultFont"" font in UIDefaults will be returned instead . "
Deletes the medium indicated by oldMedium from the list . 
Creates a VoidValue .  This value can be passed to ThreadReference . forceEarlyReturn ( com . sun . jdi . Value )  when a void method is to be exited . 
Sets the designated parameter to a Reader object .  The reader must contain the number of characters specified by length otherwise a SQLException will be generated when the CallableStatement is executed .  This method differs from the setCharacterStream (int ,  Reader ,  int )  method because it informs the driver that the parameter value should be sent to the server as a NCLOB .  When the setCharacterStream method is used ,  the driver may have to do extra work to determine whether the parameter data should be send to the server as a LONGNVARCHAR or a NCLOB
Returns the version of this resource . 
Sets the behavior when focus is lost .  This will be one of JFormattedTextField . COMMIT _ OR _ REVERT ,  JFormattedTextField . REVERT ,  JFormattedTextField . COMMIT or JFormattedTextField . PERSIST Note that some AbstractFormatters may push changes as they occur ,  so that the value of this will have no effect .  This will throw an IllegalArgumentException if the object passed in is not one of the afore mentioned values .  The default value of this property is JFormattedTextField . COMMIT _ OR _ REVERT . 
Initializes this cipher with a key and a set of algorithm parameters. The cipher is initialized for one of the following four operations: encryption, decryption, key wrapping or key unwrapping, depending on the value of opmode. If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters and params is null, the underlying cipher implementation is supposed to generate the required parameters itself (using provider - specific default or random values )  if it is being initialized for encryption or key wrapping, and raise an InvalidAlgorithmParameterException if it is being initialized for decryption or key unwrapping. The generated parameters can be retrieved using getParameters or getIV (if the parameter is an IV ) . If this cipher requires algorithm parameters that cannot be derived from the input parameters, and there are no reasonable provider - specific default values, initialization will necessarily fail. If this cipher (including its underlying feedback or padding scheme )  requires any random bytes (e.g., for parameter generation ) , it will get them using the SecureRandom implementation of the highest - priority installed provider as the source of randomness. (If none of the installed providers supply an implementation of SecureRandom, a system - provided source of randomness will be used. )  Note that when a Cipher object is initialized, it loses all previously - acquired state. In other words, initializing a Cipher is equivalent to creating a new instance of that Cipher and initializing it.
Returns a border from the defaults that is appropriate for the given locale .  If the value for key is not a Border ,  null is returned . 
Returns the Y offset of the tile grid relative to the origin ,  i.e. ,  the Y coordinate of the upper - left pixel of tile (0 ,  0 ) . (Note that tile (0 ,  0 )  may not actually exist. ) 
Write the buffered fields to the stream . 
Constructs a ProfileDataException with the specified detail message . 
Returns the preferred size to represent the tree in c .  If checkConsistency is true checkConsistency is messaged first . 
The namespace URI of this node ,  or null if it is unspecified (see ) .  This is not a computed value that is the result of a namespace lookup based on an examination of the namespace declarations in scope .  It is merely the namespace URI given at creation time .  For nodes of any type other than ELEMENT _ NODE and ATTRIBUTE _ NODE and nodes created with a DOM Level 1 method ,  such as Document . createElement() ,  this is always null .  Note: Per the Namespaces in XML Specification [XML Namespaces ]  an attribute does not inherit its namespace from the element it is attached to .  If an attribute is not explicitly given a namespace ,  it simply has no namespace . 
Gets column width .  The meaning of what a column is can be considered a fairly weak notion for some fonts .  This method is used to define the width of a column .  By default this is defined to be the width of the character m for the font used .  This method can be redefined to be some alternative amount . 
Indicate the progress of the operation being monitored .  If the specified value is >= the maximum ,  the progress monitor is closed . 
Determines whether the table will create default columns from the model .  If true ,  setModel will clear any existing columns and create new columns from the new model .  Also ,  if the event in the tableChanged notification specifies that the entire table changed ,  then the columns will be rebuilt .  The default is true . 
Returns the text contained in this TextComponent .  If the underlying document is null ,  will give a NullPointerException .  Note that text is not a bound property ,  so no PropertyChangeEvent is fired when it changes .  To listen for changes to the text ,  use DocumentListener . 
Paints the border of the track of a scrollbar .  The track contains the thumb .  This implementation invokes the method of the same name without the orientation . 
Retrieves whether this Statement object has been closed .  A Statement is closed if the method close has been called on it ,  or if it is automatically closed . 
Returns the socket address of the proxy ,  or null if its a direct connection . 
Creates a remote object . 
Constructs a new MLet for the given URLs .  The URLs will be searched in the order specified for classes and resources after first searching in the specified parent class loader .  The parent argument will be used as the parent class loader for delegation . 
Prints a document using the given Pageable object
The modifier public
Returns the size ,  in bytes ,  of the file store . 
"Returns the permissions for the given codesource object .  The implementation of this method first calls super . getPermissions and then adds permissions based on the URL of the codesource .  If the protocol of this URL is ""jar"" ,  then the permission granted is based on the permission that is required by the URL of the Jar file .  If the protocol is ""file"" and there is an authority component ,  then permission to connect to and accept connections from that authority may be granted .  If the protocol is ""file"" and the path specifies a file ,  then permission to read that file is granted .  If protocol is ""file"" and the path is a directory ,  permission is granted to read all files and (recursively )  all files and subdirectories contained in that directory .  If the protocol is not ""file"" ,  then permission to connect to and accept connections from the URL's host is granted . "
Adds a listener to a registered MBean .  Notifications emitted by the MBean will be forwarded to the listener .  If the source of the notification is a reference to an MBean object ,  the MBean server will replace it by that MBean's ObjectName .  Otherwise the source is unchanged . 
Gets parameter passed by constructor . 
Constructs an initially invisible ,  modeless Dialog with the specified owner Frame and title . 
"Returns the class of the most recently executing method from a class defined using a non - system class loader .  A non - system class loader is defined as being a class loader that is not equal to the system class loader (as returned by ClassLoader . getSystemClassLoader( )  )  or one of its ancestors .  This method will return null in the following three cases: All methods on the execution stack are from classes defined using the system class loader or one of its ancestors .  All methods on the execution stack up to the first ""privileged"" caller (see AccessController . doPrivileged(java . security . PrivilegedAction < T >  )  )  are from classes defined using the system class loader or one of its ancestors .  A call to checkPermission with java . security .

Writes a sequence of chars to the stream at the current position .  If len is 0 ,  nothing is written .  The char c [ off ]  is written first ,  then the char c [ off + 1 ]  ,  and so on .  The byte order of the stream is used to determine the order in which the individual bytes are written .  If the bit offset within the stream is non - zero ,  the remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s and written out first .  The bit offset will be 0 after the write . 
Returns the value of the client info property specified by name .  This method may return null if the specified client info property has not been set and does not have a default value .  This method will also return null if the specified client info property name is not supported by the driver .  Applications may use the DatabaseMetaData . getClientInfoProperties method to determine the client info properties supported by the driver . 
Returns the value for the given class .  If no value has yet been computed, it is obtained by an invocation of the computeValue method .  The actual installation of the value on the class is performed atomically .  At that point, if several racing threads have computed values, one is chosen, and returned to all the racing threads .  The type parameter is typically a class, but it may be any type, such as an interface, a primitive type (like int . class ) , or void . class .  In the absence of remove calls, a class value has a simple state diagram: uninitialized and initialized .  When remove calls are made, the rules for value observation are more complex .  See the documentation for remove for more information .

Selects the text between the specified start and end positions .  This method sets the start and end positions of the selected text ,  enforcing the restriction that the start position must be greater than or equal to zero .  The end position must be greater than or equal to the start position ,  and less than or equal to the length of the text component's text .  If the caller supplies values that are inconsistent or out of bounds ,  the method enforces these constraints silently ,  and without failure .  Specifically ,  if the start position or end position is greater than the length of the text ,  it is reset to equal the text length .  If the start position is less than zero ,  it is reset to zero ,  and if the end position is less than the start position ,  it is reset to the start position .  This call is provided for backward compatibility .  It is routed to a call to setCaretPosition followed by a call to moveCaretPosition .  The preferred way to manage selection is by calling those methods directly .

Returns the TypeCode corresponding to the value held in this ByteHolder object . 
Adds the specified Point to the bounds of this Rectangle .  If this Rectangle has any dimension less than zero ,  the rules for non - existant rectangles apply .  In that case ,  the new bounds of this Rectangle will have a location equal to the coordinates of the specified Point and width and height equal to zero .  After adding a Point ,  a call to contains with the added Point as an argument does not necessarily return true .  The contains method does not return true for points on the right or bottom edges of a Rectangle .  Therefore if the added Point falls on the right or bottom edge of the enlarged Rectangle ,  contains returns false for that Point .  If the specified point must be contained within the new Rectangle ,  a 1x1 rectangle should be added instead: r . add ( pt . x ,  pt . y ,  1 ,  1 ) ;

subclasses may envelope to monitor veto child property changes . 
Closes this connection server .  This method first calls the closeServer ( ) method so that no new client connections will be accepted .  Then ,  for each remaining RMIConnection object returned by makeClient ,  its close method is called .  The behavior when this method is called more than once is unspecified .  If closeServer ( ) throws an IOException ,  the individual connections are nevertheless closed ,  and then the IOException is thrown from this method .  If closeServer ( ) returns normally but one or more of the individual connections throws an IOException ,  then ,  after closing all the connections ,  one of those IOExceptions is thrown from this method .  If more than one connection throws an IOException ,  it is unspecified which one is thrown from this method . 
The value used to represent a bad policy value error in a PolicyError exception . 
The object's remote reference .

Sets the number of rows for this TextArea .  Calls invalidate ( ) after setting the new value . 
If the image is able to be rendered at an arbitrary size ,  sets the source width and height to the supplied values .  Note that the values returned from the getWidth and getHeight methods on ImageReader are not affected by this method; they will continue to return the default size for the image .  Similarly ,  if the image is also tiled the tile width and height are given in terms of the default size .  Typically ,  the width and height should be chosen such that the ratio of width to height closely approximates the aspect ratio of the image ,  as returned from ImageReader . getAspectRatio .  If this plug - in does not allow the rendering size to be set ,  an UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown .  To remove the render size setting ,  pass in a value of null for size . 
Deletes a file .  This method works in exactly the manner specified by the Files . delete ( java . nio . file . Path )  method . 
Calculates the maximum size dimensions for the specified container ,  given the components it contains . 
Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are strictly less than toKey .  The returned map is backed by this map ,  so changes in the returned map are reflected in this map ,  and vice - versa .

Encodes the specified byte array into a String using the Base64 encoding scheme. This method first encodes all input bytes into a base64 encoded byte array and then constructs a new String by using the encoded byte array and the ISO - 8859 - 1 charset. In other words, an invocation of this method has exactly the same effect as invoking new String ( encode ( src ) , StandardCharsets.ISO _ 8859 _ 1 ) .
Sets the number of copies the application should render for jobs using these attributes to the default .  The default number of copies is 1 . 
"Unicode script ""Carian"" . "

Creates a new XML encoder to write out JavaBeans to the stream out using the given charset starting from the given indentation . 
Indicates to the interceptor that an exception occurred .  Allows an Interceptor to query the exception's information before it is thrown to the client .  This interception point may throw a system exception .  This has the effect of changing the exception which successive Interceptors popped from the Flow Stack receive on their calls to receive _ exception .  The exception thrown to the client will be the last exception thrown by an Interceptor ,  or the original exception if no Interceptor changes the exception .  This interception point may also throw a ForwardRequest exception .  If an Interceptor throws this exception ,  no other Interceptors' receive _ exception operations are called .  The remaining Interceptors in the Flow Stack are popped and have their receive _ other interception point called .  If the completion _ status of the exception is not COMPLETED _ NO ,  then it is inappropriate for this interception point to throw a ForwardRequest exception .  The request s at - most - once semantics would be lost .  Compliant Interceptors shall properly follow completion _ status semantics if they throw a system exception from this interception point .  If the original exception is a system exception ,  the completion _ status of the new exception shall be the same as on the original .  If the original exception is a user exception ,  then the completion _ status of the new exception shall be COMPLETED _ YES .  Under some conditions ,  depending on what policies are in effect ,  an exception (such as COMM _ FAILURE )  may result in a retry of the request .  While this retry is a new request with respect to Interceptors ,  there is one point of correlation between the original request and the retry: because control has not returned to the client ,  the PortableInterceptor . Current for both the original request and the retrying request is the same .

Inserts the specified element at the front of this deque if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions ,  returning true upon success and false if no space is currently available .  When using a capacity - restricted deque ,  this method is generally preferable to the addFirst method ,  which can fail to insert an element only by throwing an exception . 
Removes a listener from this MBean .  If the listener has been registered with different handback objects or notification filters ,  all entries corresponding to the listener will be removed . 
Returns a transform representing a scaling transformation .  The matrix representing the returned transform is: [ sx 0 0 ] [ 0 sy 0 ] [ 0 0 1 ]
Calls the UI delegate's paint method ,  if the UI delegate is non - null. We pass the delegate a copy of the Graphics object to protect the rest of the paint code from irrevocable changes (for example ,  Graphics.translate ) . If you override this in a subclass you should not make permanent changes to the passed in Graphics. For example ,  you should not alter the clip Rectangle or modify the transform. If you need to do these operations you may find it easier to create a new Graphics from the passed in Graphics and manipulate it. Further ,  if you do not invoker super's implementation you must honor the opaque property ,  that is if this component is opaque ,  you must completely fill in the background in a non - opaque color. If you do not honor the opaque property you will likely see visual artifacts. The passed in Graphics object might have a transform other than the identify transform installed on it. In this case ,  you might get unexpected results if you cumulatively apply another transform.

Removes a tile observer .  If the observer was not registered ,  nothing happens .  If the observer was registered for multiple notifications ,  it is now registered for one fewer notification . 
Identical to ORB . register _ initial _ reference .  This same functionality exists here because the ORB ,  not yet fully initialized ,  is not yet available but initial references may need to be registered as part of Interceptor registration .  The only difference is that the version of this operation on the ORB uses PIDL (CORBA . ORB . ObjectId )  and (CORBA . ORB . InvalidName )  whereas the version in this interface uses IDL defined in this interface; the semantics are identical .

Requests that this Component gets the input focus .  Refer to Component . requestFocusInWindow ( ) for a complete description of this method .  If you would like more information on focus ,  see How to Use the Focus Subsystem ,  a section in The Java Tutorial . 
Atomically updates the field of the given object managed by this updater with the results of applying the given function to the current and given values ,  returning the updated value .  The function should be side - effect - free ,  since it may be re - applied when attempted updates fail due to contention among threads .  The function is applied with the current value as its first argument ,  and the given update as the second argument . 
Returns a constant identifying the type of Window decorations the JRootPane is providing . 
"Returns the canonical string representation of the actions ,  which currently is the empty string """" ,  since there are no actions for a BasicPermission . "
Returns a BufferedImage as the result of decoding a supplied InputStream with an ImageReader chosen automatically from among those currently registered .  The InputStream is wrapped in an ImageInputStream .  If no registered ImageReader claims to be able to read the resulting stream ,  null is returned .  The current cache settings from getUseCacheand getCacheDirectory will be used to control caching in the ImageInputStream that is created .  This method does not attempt to locate ImageReaders that can read directly from an InputStream; that may be accomplished using IIORegistry and ImageReaderSpi .  This method does not close the provided InputStream after the read operation has completed; it is the responsibility of the caller to close the stream ,  if desired . 
This flag bit indicates that the transform defined by this object performs a rotation by an arbitrary angle in addition to the conversions indicated by other flag bits .  A rotation changes the angles of vectors by the same amount regardless of the original direction of the vector and without changing the length of the vector .  This flag bit is mutually exclusive with the TYPE _ QUADRANT _ ROTATION flag . 
Removes the specified preference change listener ,  so it no longer receives preference change events . 
Sets the background color of this window. If the windowing system supports the PERPIXEL _ TRANSLUCENT translucency, the alpha component of the given background color may effect the mode of operation for this window: it indicates whether this window must be opaque (alpha equals 1.0f )  or per - pixel translucent (alpha is less than 1.0f ) . If the given background color is null, the window is considered completely opaque. All the following conditions must be met to enable the per - pixel transparency mode for this window: The PERPIXEL _ TRANSLUCENT translucency must be supported by the graphics device where this window is located The window must be undecorated (see setUndecorated(boolean )  and Dialog.setUndecorated(boolean )  )  The window must not be in full - screen mode (see GraphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindow(Window )  )  If the alpha component of the requested background color is less than 1.0f, and any of the above conditions are not met, the background color of this window will not change, the alpha component of the given background color will not affect the mode of operation for this window, and either the UnsupportedOperationException or IllegalComponentStateException will be thrown. When the window is per - pixel translucent, the drawing sub - system respects the alpha value of each individual pixel. If a pixel gets painted with the alpha color component equal to zero, it becomes visually transparent. If the alpha of the pixel is equal to 1.0f, the pixel is fully opaque. Interim values of the alpha color component make the pixel semi - transparent. In this mode, the background of the window gets painted with the alpha value of the given background color. If the alpha value of the argument of this method is equal to 0, the background is not painted at all. The actual level of translucency of a given pixel also depends on window opacity (see Window.setOpacity(float )  ) , as well as the current shape of this window (see Window.setShape(Shape )  ) . Note that painting a pixel with the alpha value of 0 may or may not disable the mouse event handling on this pixel. This is a platform - dependent behavior. To make sure the mouse events do not get dispatched to a particular pixel, the pixel must be excluded from the shape of the window. Enabling the per - pixel translucency mode may change the graphics configuration of this window due to the native platform requirements.
Constructs a deque initially containing the elements of the given collection ,  added in traversal order of the collection's iterator . 
Called by the constructor methods to create the default contentPane .  By default this method creates a new JComponent add sets a BorderLayout as its LayoutManager . 
Determines the minimum span for this view along an axis . 
Updates (replace )  the access control list .  Where the file system supports Access Control Lists, and it uses an ACL model that differs from the NFSv4 defined ACL model, then this method must translate the ACL to the model supported by the file system .  This method should reject (by throwing IOException )  any attempt to write an ACL that would appear to make the file more secure than would be the case if the ACL were updated .  Where an implementation does not support a mapping of AclEntryType . AUDIT or AclEntryType . ALARM entries, then this method ignores these entries when writing the ACL .  If an ACL entry contains a user - principal that is not associated with the same provider as this attribute view then ProviderMismatchException is thrown .  Additional validation, if any, is implementation dependent .  If the file system supports other security related file attributes (such as a file access - permissions for example ) , the updating the access control list may also cause these security related attributes to be updated .

Sets the policy which the tabbedpane will use in laying out the tabs when all the tabs will not fit within a single run .  Possible values are: JTabbedPane . WRAP _ TAB _ LAYOUT JTabbedPane . SCROLL _ TAB _ LAYOUT The default value ,  if not set by the UI ,  is JTabbedPane . WRAP _ TAB _ LAYOUT .  Some look and feels might only support a subset of the possible layout policies ,  in which case the value of this property may be ignored . 
Retrieves the TypeCode object that represents the given primitive IDL type . 
"Returns the preference node from the calling user's preference tree that is associated (by convention )  with the specified class's package. The convention is as follows: the absolute path name of the node is the fully qualified package name, preceded by a slash ('/' ) , and with each period ('.' )  replaced by a slash. For example the absolute path name of the node associated with the class com.acme.widget.Foo is /com/acme/widget. This convention does not apply to the unnamed package, whose associated preference node is <unnamed > . This node is not intended for long term use, but for convenience in the early development of programs that do not yet belong to a package, and for ""throwaway"" programs. Valuable data should not be stored at this node as it is shared by all programs that use it. A class Foo wishing to access preferences pertaining to its package can obtain a preference node as follows: static Preferences prefs = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(Foo.class ) ; This idiom obviates the need for using a string to describe the preferences node and decreases the likelihood of a run - time failure. (If the class name is misspelled, it will typically result in a compile - time error. )  Invoking this method will result in the creation of the returned node and its ancestors if they do not already exist. If the returned node did not exist prior to this call, this node and any ancestors that were created by this call are not guaranteed to become permanent until the flush method is called on the returned node (or one of its ancestors or descendants ) ."

Constructs a DirectColorModel from the specified masks that indicate which bits in an int pixel representation contain the red ,  green and blue color samples and the alpha sample ,  if present .  If amask is 0 ,  pixel values do not contain alpha information and all pixels are treated as opaque ,  which means that alpha = 1 . 0 .  All of the bits in each mask must be contiguous and fit in the specified number of least significant bits of an int pixel representation .  Alpha ,  if present ,  is not premultiplied .  The ColorSpace is the default sRGB space .  The transparency value is Transparency . OPAQUE if no alpha is present ,  or Transparency . TRANSLUCENT otherwise .  The transfer type is the smallest of DataBuffer . TYPE _ BYTE ,  DataBuffer . TYPE _ USHORT ,  or DataBuffer . TYPE _ INT that can hold a single pixel . 
Gets the offset within the composed text for the specified absolute x and y coordinates on the screen .  This information is used ,  for example to handle mouse clicks and the mouse cursor .  The offset is relative to the composed text ,  so offset 0 indicates the beginning of the composed text .  Return null if the location is outside the area occupied by the composed text . 
Returns the hash code value for this Permission object .  The required hashCode behavior for Permission Objects is the following: Whenever it is invoked on the same Permission object more than once during an execution of a Java application ,  the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer .  This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application .  If two Permission objects are equal according to the equals method ,  then calling the hashCode method on each of the two Permission objects must produce the same integer result . 
Identifies one or more changes in the lists contents .

Create a PixelGrabber object to grab the (x, y, w, h )  rectangular section of pixels from the specified image .  The pixels are accumulated in the original ColorModel if the same ColorModel is used for every call to setPixels, otherwise the pixels are accumulated in the default RGB ColorModel .  If the forceRGB parameter is true, then the pixels will be accumulated in the default RGB ColorModel anyway .  A buffer is allocated by the PixelGrabber to hold the pixels in either case .  If (w < 0 )  or (h < 0 ) , then they will default to the remaining width and height of the source data when that information is delivered . 
Returns the result value when complete ,  or throws an (unchecked )  exception if completed exceptionally .

"Returns the name of the ""native"" metadata format for this plug - in ,  which typically allows for lossless encoding and transmission of the metadata stored in the format handled by this plug - in .  If no such format is supported ,  nullwill be returned .  The structure and contents of the ""native"" metadata format are defined by the plug - in that created this IIOMetadata object .  Plug - ins for simple formats will usually create a dummy node for the root ,  and then a series of child nodes representing individual tags ,  chunks ,  or keyword/value pairs .  A plug - in may choose whether or not to document its native format .  The default implementation returns the value of the nativeMetadataFormatName instance variable . "
Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified sorted map .  Any attempt to insert a mapping whose key or value have the wrong type will result in an immediate ClassCastException .  Similarly, any attempt to modify the value currently associated with a key will result in an immediate ClassCastException, whether the modification is attempted directly through the map itself, or through a Map . Entry instance obtained from the map's entry set view .  Assuming a map contains no incorrectly typed keys or values prior to the time a dynamically typesafe view is generated, and that all subsequent access to the map takes place through the view (or one of its collection views ) , it is guaranteed that the map cannot contain an incorrectly typed key or value .  A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be found in the documentation for the checkedCollection method .  The returned map will be serializable if the specified map is serializable .  Since null is considered to be a value of any reference type, the returned map permits insertion of null keys or values whenever the backing map does . 
Returns the socket address that this channel's socket is bound to .  Where the channel is bound to an Internet Protocol socket address then the return value from this method is of type InetSocketAddress .  If there is a security manager set ,  its checkConnect method is called with the local address and -1 as its arguments to see if the operation is allowed .  If the operation is not allowed ,  a SocketAddress representing the loopback address and the local port of the channel's socket is returned .

Tests if the interior of the Shape intersects the interior of a specified rectangular area .  The rectangular area is considered to intersect the Shape if any point is contained in both the interior of the Shape and the specified rectangular area .  The Shape . intersects ( ) method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return true when: there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the Shape intersect ,  but the calculations to accurately determine this intersection are prohibitively expensive .  This means that for some Shapes this method might return true even though the rectangular area does not intersect the Shape .  The Area class performs more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required .

Overridden for performance reasons .  See the Implementation Note for more information . 
This method is called by the current KeyboardFocusManager, requesting that this KeyEventPostProcessor perform any necessary post - processing which should be part of the KeyEvent's final resolution .  At the time this method is invoked, typically the KeyEvent has already been dispatched to and handled by its target .  However, if no Component in the application currently owns the focus, then the KeyEvent has not been dispatched to any Component .  Typically, KeyEvent post - processing will be used to implement features which require global KeyEvent post - handling, such as menu shortcuts .  Note that if a KeyEventPostProcessor wishes to dispatch the KeyEvent, it must use redispatchEvent to prevent the AWT from recursively requesting that this KeyEventPostProcessor perform post - processing of the event again .  If an implementation of this method returns false, then the KeyEvent is passed to the next KeyEventPostProcessor in the chain, ending with the current KeyboardFocusManager .  If an implementation returns true, the KeyEvent is assumed to have been fully handled (although this need not be the case ) , and the AWT will take no further action with regard to the KeyEvent .  If an implementation consumes the KeyEvent but returns false, the consumed event will still be passed to the next KeyEventPostProcessor in the chain .  It is important for developers to check whether the KeyEvent has been consumed before performing any post - processing of the KeyEvent .  By default, the current KeyboardFocusManager will perform no post -  processing in response to a consumed KeyEvent .

Sets the Object whose string representation will be used as the value for the headerRenderer .  When the TableColumn is created ,  the default headerValue is null . 
"Returns the ""first day of next month"" adjuster ,  which returns a new date set to the first day of the next month. The ISO calendar system behaves as follows: The input 2011 - 01 - 15 will return 2011 - 02 - 01. The input 2011 - 02 - 15 will return 2011 - 03 - 01. The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems. It is equivalent to: temporal.with ( DAY _ OF _ MONTH ,  1 ) .plus ( 1 ,  MONTHS ) ;"

Set (or change )  the object that is to be edited . 
Performs a reduction on the elements of this stream ,  using an associative accumulation function ,  and returns an OptionalInt describing the reduced value ,  if any .  This is equivalent to: boolean foundAny = false; int result = null; for (int element : this stream )  { if (!foundAny )  { foundAny = true; result = element; } else result = accumulator . applyAsInt(result ,  element ) ; } return foundAny ? OptionalInt . of(result )  : OptionalInt . empty( ) ; but is not constrained to execute sequentially .  The accumulator function must be an associative function .  This is a terminal operation .

Gets the value of the specified field from this month - of - year as an int .  This queries this month for the value of the specified field .  The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field .  If it is not possible to return the value ,  because the field is not supported or for some other reason ,  an exception is thrown .  If the field is MONTH _ OF _ YEAR then the value of the month - of - year ,  from 1 to 12 ,  will be returned .  All other ChronoField instances will throw an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException .  If the field is not a ChronoField ,  then the result of this method is obtained by invoking TemporalField . getFrom ( TemporalAccessor )  passing this as the argument .  Whether the value can be obtained ,  and what the value represents ,  is determined by the field . 
Create Bidi from the given paragraph of text. The RUN _ DIRECTION attribute in the text ,  if present ,  determines the base direction (left-to-right or right-to-left ) . If not present ,  the base direction is computes using the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm ,  defaulting to left-to-right if there are no strong directional characters in the text. This attribute ,  if present ,  must be applied to all the text in the paragraph. The BIDI _ EMBEDDING attribute in the text ,  if present ,  represents embedding level information. Negative values from -1 to -62 indicate overrides at the absolute value of the level. Positive values from 1 to 62 indicate embeddings. Where values are zero or not defined ,  the base embedding level as determined by the base direction is assumed. The NUMERIC _ SHAPING attribute in the text ,  if present ,  converts European digits to other decimal digits before running the bidi algorithm. This attribute ,  if present ,  must be applied to all the text in the paragraph.

"Returns a string representation of the object .  In general ,  the toString method returns a string that ""textually represents"" this object .  The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read .  It is recommended that all subclasses override this method .  The toString method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance ,  the at - sign character `@' ,  and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object .  In other words ,  this method returns a string equal to the value of: getClass ( ) . getName ( ) + '@' + Integer . toHexString ( hashCode ( ))"

Gets all the components in this container .  Note: This method should be called under AWT tree lock . 
Sets the background color of this window. If the windowing system supports the PERPIXEL _ TRANSLUCENT translucency, the alpha component of the given background color may effect the mode of operation for this window: it indicates whether this window must be opaque (alpha equals 1.0f )  or per - pixel translucent (alpha is less than 1.0f ) . If the given background color is null, the window is considered completely opaque. All the following conditions must be met to enable the per - pixel transparency mode for this window: The PERPIXEL _ TRANSLUCENT translucency must be supported by the graphics device where this window is located The window must be undecorated (see Frame.setUndecorated(boolean )  and setUndecorated(boolean )  )  The window must not be in full - screen mode (see GraphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindow(Window )  )  If the alpha component of the requested background color is less than 1.0f, and any of the above conditions are not met, the background color of this window will not change, the alpha component of the given background color will not affect the mode of operation for this window, and either the UnsupportedOperationException or IllegalComponentStateException will be thrown. When the window is per - pixel translucent, the drawing sub - system respects the alpha value of each individual pixel. If a pixel gets painted with the alpha color component equal to zero, it becomes visually transparent. If the alpha of the pixel is equal to 1.0f, the pixel is fully opaque. Interim values of the alpha color component make the pixel semi - transparent. In this mode, the background of the window gets painted with the alpha value of the given background color. If the alpha value of the argument of this method is equal to 0, the background is not painted at all. The actual level of translucency of a given pixel also depends on window opacity (see Window.setOpacity(float )  ) , as well as the current shape of this window (see Window.setShape(Shape )  ) . Note that painting a pixel with the alpha value of 0 may or may not disable the mouse event handling on this pixel. This is a platform - dependent behavior. To make sure the mouse events do not get dispatched to a particular pixel, the pixel must be excluded from the shape of the window. Enabling the per - pixel translucency mode may change the graphics configuration of this window due to the native platform requirements.
A constant returned by getAttributeValueType and getObjectValueType to indicate that the attribute or user object may be set to a range of values .  The minimum (but not the maximum )  value of the range is inclusive .

Returns the floating - point number adjacent to the first argument in the direction of the second argument. If both arguments compare as equal the second argument is returned. Special cases: If either argument is a NaN ,  then NaN is returned. If both arguments are signed zeros ,  direction is returned unchanged (as implied by the requirement of returning the second argument if the arguments compare as equal ) . If start is Â±Double.MIN _ VALUE and direction has a value such that the result should have a smaller magnitude ,  then a zero with the same sign as start is returned. If start is infinite and direction has a value such that the result should have a smaller magnitude ,  Double.MAX _ VALUE with the same sign as start is returned. If start is equal to Â± Double.MAX _ VALUE and direction has a value such that the result should have a larger magnitude ,  an infinity with same sign as start is returned.

Returns a collection view of the index to row mappings contained in this TabularDataSupport instance. Each element in the returned collection is a Map.Entry < List < ? >  , CompositeData >  but is declared as a Map.Entry < Object , Object >  for compatibility reasons. Each of the map entry keys is an unmodifiable List < ? > . The collection is backed by the underlying map of this TabularDataSupport instance ,  so changes to the TabularDataSupport instance are reflected in the collection ,  and vice - versa. The collection supports element removal ,  which removes the corresponding mapping from the map ,  via the Iterator.remove ( ) ,  Collection.remove ( java.lang.Object) ,  Collection.removeAll ( java.util.Collection < ? > ) ,  Collection.retainAll ( java.util.Collection < ? > ) ,  and Collection.clear ( ) operations. It does not support the Collection.add ( E) or Collection.addAll ( java.util.Collection < ? extends E > ) operations. IMPORTANT NOTICE: Do not use the setValue method of the Map.Entry elements contained in the returned collection view. Doing so would corrupt the index to row mappings contained in this TabularDataSupport instance.
Negotiates a TLS session using an SSL socket factory .  Creates an SSL socket using the supplied SSL socket factory and attaches it to the existing connection .  Performs the TLS handshake and returns the negotiated session information .  If cipher suites have been set via setEnabledCipherSuites then they are enabled before the TLS handshake begins .  Hostname verification is performed after the TLS handshake completes .  The default hostname verification performs a match of the server's hostname against the hostname information found in the server's certificate .  If this verification fails and no callback has been set via setHostnameVerifier then the negotiation fails .  If this verification fails and a callback has been set via setHostnameVerifier ,  then the callback is used to determine whether the negotiation succeeds .  If an error occurs then the SSL socket is closed and an IOException is thrown .  The underlying connection remains intact . 
This method is called by installUI to get the editor component of the JSpinner .  By default it just returns JSpinner . getEditor ( ) .  Subclasses can override createEditor to return a component that contains the spinner's editor or null ,  if they're going to handle adding the editor to the JSpinner in an installUI override .  Typically this method would be overridden to wrap the editor with a container with a custom border ,  since one can't assume that the editors border can be set directly .  The replaceEditor method is called when the spinners editor is changed with JSpinner . setEditor .  If you've overriden this method ,  then you'll probably want to override replaceEditor as well .

Gets the value of the specified field from this instant as a long .  This queries this instant for the value of the specified field .  If it is not possible to return the value ,  because the field is not supported or for some other reason ,  an exception is thrown .  If the field is a ChronoField then the query is implemented here .  The supported fields will return valid values based on this date - time .  All other ChronoField instances will throw an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException .  If the field is not a ChronoField ,  then the result of this method is obtained by invoking TemporalField . getFrom ( TemporalAccessor )  passing this as the argument .  Whether the value can be obtained ,  and what the value represents ,  is determined by the field . 
Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on the given condition associated with the write lock .  Note that because timeouts and interrupts may occur at any time ,  the estimate serves only as an upper bound on the actual number of waiters .

Reads characters into a portion of an array .  This method implements the general contract of the corresponding read method of the Reader class .  As an additional convenience ,  it attempts to read as many characters as possible by repeatedly invoking the read method of the underlying stream .  This iterated read continues until one of the following conditions becomes true: The specified number of characters have been read ,  The read method of the underlying stream returns -1 ,  indicating end-of-file ,  or The ready method of the underlying stream returns false ,  indicating that further input requests would block .  If the first read on the underlying stream returns -1 to indicate end-of-file then this method returns -1 .  Otherwise this method returns the number of characters actually read .  Subclasses of this class are encouraged ,  but not required ,  to attempt to read as many characters as possible in the same fashion .  Ordinarily this method takes characters from this stream's character buffer ,  filling it from the underlying stream as necessary .  If ,  however ,  the buffer is empty ,  the mark is not valid ,  and the requested length is at least as large as the buffer ,  then this method will read characters directly from the underlying stream into the given array .  Thus redundant BufferedReaders will not copy data unnecessarily . 
Assigns the specified boolean value to each element of the specified array of booleans . 
Reads a boolean from this file .  This method reads a single byte from the file ,  starting at the current file pointer .  A value of 0 represents false .  Any other value represents true .  This method blocks until the byte is read ,  the end of the stream is detected ,  or an exception is thrown . 
Resets this matcher and then attempts to find the next subsequence of the input sequence that matches the pattern ,  starting at the specified index .  If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the start ,  end ,  and group methods ,  and subsequent invocations of the find ( ) method will start at the first character not matched by this match . 
Overrides Graphics . drawImage . 
Specifies the print orientation for pages using these attributes .  Not specifying the property is equivalent to specifying OrientationRequestedType . PORTRAIT . 
Copies the specified range of the specified array into a new array. The initial index of the range (from )  must lie between zero and original.length, inclusive. The value at original [ from ]  is placed into the initial element of the copy (unless from == original.length or from == to ) . Values from subsequent elements in the original array are placed into subsequent elements in the copy. The final index of the range (to ) , which must be greater than or equal to from, may be greater than original.length, in which case 0d is placed in all elements of the copy whose index is greater than or equal to original.length - from. The length of the returned array will be to - from.

The size of the socket receive buffer .  The value of this socket option is an Integer that is the size of the socket receive buffer in bytes .  The socket receive buffer is an input buffer used by the networking implementation .  It may need to be increased for high - volume connections or decreased to limit the possible backlog of incoming data .  The value of the socket option is a hint to the implementation to size the buffer and the actual size may differ .  For datagram - oriented sockets ,  the size of the receive buffer may limit the size of the datagrams that can be received .  Whether datagrams larger than the buffer size can be received is system dependent .  Increasing the socket receive buffer may be important for cases where datagrams arrive in bursts faster than they can be processed .  In the case of stream - oriented sockets and the TCP/IP protocol ,  the size of the socket receive buffer may be used when advertising the size of the TCP receive window to the remote peer .  The initial/default size of the socket receive buffer and the range of allowable values is system dependent although a negative size is not allowed .  An attempt to set the socket receive buffer to larger than its maximum size causes it to be set to its maximum size .  An implementation allows this socket option to be set before the socket is bound or connected .  Whether an implementation allows the socket receive buffer to be changed after the socket is bound is system dependent . 
If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped to null ) , attempts to compute its value using the given mapping function and enters it into this map unless null. If the function returns null no mapping is recorded. If the function itself throws an (unchecked )  exception, the exception is rethrown, and no mapping is recorded. The most common usage is to construct a new object serving as an initial mapped value or memoized result, as in: map.computeIfAbsent(key, k - >  new Value(f(k )  )  ) ; Or to implement a multi-value map, Map < K,Collection < V >  > , supporting multiple values per key: map.computeIfAbsent(key, k - >  new HashSet < V > ( )  ) .add(v ) ;

Releases the current contents of this CachedRowSet object and sends a rowSetChanged event to all registered listeners .  Any outstanding updates are discarded and the rowset contains no rows after this method is called .  There are no interactions with the underlying data source ,  and any rowset content ,  metadata ,  and content updates should be non - recoverable .  This CachedRowSet object should lock until its contents and associated updates are fully cleared ,  thus preventing 'dirty' reads by other components that hold a reference to this RowSet object .  In addition ,  the contents cannot be released until all all components reading this CachedRowSet object have completed their reads .  This CachedRowSet object should be returned to normal behavior after firing the rowSetChanged event .  The metadata ,  including JDBC properties and Synchronization SPI properties ,  are maintained for future use .  It is important that properties such as the command property be relevant to the originating data source from which this CachedRowSet object was originally established .  This method empties a rowset ,  as opposed to the close method ,  which marks the entire rowset as recoverable to allow the garbage collector the rowset's Java VM resources .

Handles the method MBeanServerConnection.addNotificationListener(ObjectName ,  NotificationListener ,  NotificationFilter ,  Object ) . Register for notifications from the given MBeans that match the given filters. The remote client can subsequently retrieve the notifications using the fetchNotifications method. For each listener ,  the original NotificationListener and handback are kept on the client side; in order for the client to be able to identify them ,  the server generates and returns a unique listenerID. This listenerID is forwarded with the Notifications to the remote client. If any one of the given (name ,  filter )  pairs cannot be registered ,  then the operation fails with an exception ,  and no names or filters are registered.

"Constant for the "" _ "" key . "
Retrieves the contents of this URL connection .  This method first determines the content type of the object by calling the getContentType method .  If this is the first time that the application has seen that specific content type, a content handler for that content type is created: If the application has set up a content handler factory instance using the setContentHandlerFactory method, the createContentHandler method of that instance is called with the content type as an argument; the result is a content handler for that content type .  If no content handler factory has yet been set up, or if the factory's createContentHandler method returns null, then the application loads the class named: sun . net . www . content . <contentType >  where <contentType >  is formed by taking the content - type string, replacing all slash characters with a period (' . ' ) , and all other non - alphanumeric characters with the underscore character ' _ ' .  The alphanumeric characters are specifically the 26 uppercase ASCII letters 'A' through 'Z', the 26 lowercase ASCII letters 'a' through 'z', and the 10 ASCII digits '0' through '9' .  If the specified class does not exist, or is not a subclass of ContentHandler, then an UnknownServiceException is thrown .

Discards the current mappings for the specified DataFlavor and all DataFlavors equal to the specified DataFlavor ,  and creates new mappings to the specified String natives .  Unlike getNativesForFlavor ,  the mappings will only be established in one direction ,  and the natives will not be encoded .  To establish two - way mappings ,  call setFlavorsForNative as well .  The first native in the array will represent the highest priority mapping .  Subsequent natives will represent mappings of decreasing priority .  If the array contains several elements that reference equal String natives ,  this method will establish new mappings for the first of those elements and ignore the rest of them .  It is recommended that client code not reset mappings established by the data transfer subsystem .  This method should only be used for application - level mappings .

Checks if the year is a leap year ,  according to the ISO proleptic calendar system rules .  This method applies the current rules for leap years across the whole time-line .  In general ,  a year is a leap year if it is divisible by four without remainder .  However ,  years divisible by 100 ,  are not leap years ,  with the exception of years divisible by 400 which are .  For example ,  1904 is a leap year it is divisible by 4 .  1900 was not a leap year as it is divisible by 100 ,  however 2000 was a leap year as it is divisible by 400 .  The calculation is proleptic - applying the same rules into the far future and far past .  This is historically inaccurate ,  but is correct for the ISO-8601 standard .

Contains information about the change that generated this event . 
Creates a new disabled StepRequest .  The new event request is added to the list managed by this EventRequestManager .  Use EventRequest . enable ( ) to activate this event request .  The returned request will control stepping only in the specified thread; all other threads will be unaffected .  A sizevalue of StepRequest . STEP _ MIN will generate a step event each time the code index changes .  It represents the smallest step size available and often maps to the instruction level .  A size value of StepRequest . STEP _ LINE will generate a step event each time the source line changes unless line number information is not available ,  in which case a STEP _ MIN will be done instead .  For example ,  no line number information is available during the execution of a method that has been rendered obsolete by by a VirtualMachine . redefineClasses ( java . util . Map < ? extends com . sun . jdi . ReferenceType ,  byte [ ] > ) operation .  A depth value of StepRequest . STEP _ INTO will generate step events in any called methods .  A depth value of StepRequest . STEP _ OVER restricts step events to the current frame or caller frames .  A depth value of StepRequest . STEP _ OUT restricts step events to caller frames only .  All depth restrictions are relative to the call stack immediately before the step takes place .  Only one pending step request is allowed per thread .  Note that a typical debugger will want to cancel stepping after the first step is detected .  Thus a next line method would do the following: EventRequestManager mgr = myVM . eventRequestManager ( ); StepRequest request = mgr . createStepRequest ( myThread ,  StepRequest . STEP _ LINE ,  StepRequest . STEP _ OVER); request . addCountFilter ( 1); // next step only request . enable ( ); myVM . resume ( );

The value of this temporal object is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range .  If the date - time cannot return the range ,  because the field is unsupported or for some other reason ,  an exception will be thrown .  Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values and it is important not to read too much into them .  For example ,  there could be values within the range that are invalid for the field . 
The constant in the Java programming language ,  sometimes referred to as a type code ,  that identifies the generic SQL type NCLOB . 
Returns whether this attribute is known to be of type ID (i.e. to contain an identifier for its owner element) or not. When it is and its value is unique ,  the ownerElement of this attribute can be retrieved using the method Document.getElementById . The implementation could use several ways to determine if an attribute node is known to contain an identifier: If validation occurred using an XML Schema [XML Schema Part 1 ]  while loading the document or while invoking Document.normalizeDocument() ,  the post - schema - validation infoset contributions (PSVI contributions) values are used to determine if this attribute is a schema - determined ID attribute using the schema - determined ID definition in [XPointer ]  . If validation occurred using a DTD while loading the document or while invoking Document.normalizeDocument() ,  the infoset [type definition ]  value is used to determine if this attribute is a DTD - determined ID attribute using the DTD - determined ID definition in [XPointer ]  . from the use of the methods Element.setIdAttribute() ,  Element.setIdAttributeNS() ,  or Element.setIdAttributeNode() ,  i.e. it is an user - determined ID attribute; Note: XPointer framework (see section 3.2 in [XPointer ]  ) consider the DOM user - determined ID attribute as being part of the XPointer externally - determined ID definition. using mechanisms that are outside the scope of this specification ,  it is then an externally - determined ID attribute. This includes using schema languages different from XML schema and DTD. If validation occurred while invoking Document.normalizeDocument() ,  all user - determined ID attributes are reset and all attribute nodes ID information are then reevaluated in accordance to the schema used. As a consequence ,  if the Attr.schemaTypeInfo attribute contains an ID type ,  isId will always return true.

"Sets the selected file for this file dialog window to be the specified file .  This file becomes the default file if it is set before the file dialog window is first shown .  When the dialog is shown ,  the specified file is selected .  The kind of selection depends on the file existence ,  the dialog type ,  and the native platform .  E . g .  ,  the file could be highlighted in the file list ,  or a file name editbox could be populated with the file name .  This method accepts either a full file path ,  or a file name with an extension if used together with the setDirectory method .  Specifying """" as the file is exactly equivalent to specifying null as the file . "
Invoked when an action occurs . 
Reads characters into an array .  This method will block until some input is available ,  an I/O error occurs ,  or the end of the stream is reached . 
Writes every character in the string s ,  to the output stream ,  in order ,  two bytes per character. If s is null ,  a NullPointerException is thrown. If s.length is zero ,  then no characters are written. Otherwise ,  the character s [ 0 ]  is written first ,  then s [ 1 ]  ,  and so on; the last character written is s [ s.length - 1 ] . For each character ,  two bytes are actually written ,  high - order byte first ,  in exactly the manner of the writeChar method.
Prints this JTable. Takes steps that the majority of developers would take in order to print a JTable. In short ,  it prepares the table ,  calls getPrintable to fetch an appropriate Printable ,  and then sends it to the printer. A boolean parameter allows you to specify whether or not a printing dialog is displayed to the user. When it is ,  the user may use the dialog to change the destination printer or printing attributes ,  or even to cancel the print. Another two parameters allow for a PrintService and printing attributes to be specified. These parameters can be used either to provide initial values for the print dialog ,  or to specify values when the dialog is not shown. A second boolean parameter allows you to specify whether or not to perform printing in an interactive mode. If true ,  a modal progress dialog ,  with an abort option ,  is displayed for the duration of printing . This dialog also prevents any user action which may affect the table. However ,  it can not prevent the table from being modified by code (for example ,  another thread that posts updates using SwingUtilities.invokeLater ) . It is therefore the responsibility of the developer to ensure that no other code modifies the table in any way during printing (invalid modifications include changes in: size ,  renderers ,  or underlying data ) . Printing behavior is undefined when the table is changed during printing. If false is specified for this parameter ,  no dialog will be displayed and printing will begin immediately on the event - dispatch thread. This blocks any other events ,  including repaints ,  from being processed until printing is complete. Although this effectively prevents the table from being changed ,  it doesn't provide a good user experience. For this reason ,  specifying false is only recommended when printing from an application with no visible GUI. Note: Attempting to show the printing dialog or run interactively ,  while in headless mode ,  will result in a HeadlessException. Before fetching the printable ,  this method will gracefully terminate editing ,  if necessary ,  to prevent an editor from showing in the printed result. Additionally ,  JTable will prepare its renderers during printing such that selection and focus are not indicated. As far as customizing further how the table looks in the printout ,  developers can provide custom renderers or paint code that conditionalize on the value of JComponent.isPaintingForPrint( ) . See getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode ,  java.text.MessageFormat ,  java.text.MessageFormat )  for more description on how the table is printed.
Connects this socket to the specified port number on the specified host .  A timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout .  The connection will then block until established or an error occurs . 
Atomically sets the field of the given object managed by this updater to the given updated value if the current value == the expected value .  This method is guaranteed to be atomic with respect to other calls to compareAndSet and set ,  but not necessarily with respect to other changes in the field . 
Returns a copy of this LocalDateTime with the specified number of seconds subtracted .  This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call . 
Set the parent reader .  This is the XMLReader from which this filter will obtain its events and to which it will pass its configuration requests .  The parent may itself be another filter .  If there is no parent reader set ,  any attempt to parse or to set or get a feature or property will fail . 
Sets the limit for the maximum number of rows that any ResultSet object generated by this Statement object can contain to the given number .  If the limit is exceeded ,  the excess rows are silently dropped . 
Return value if approve (yes ,  ok )  is chosen . 
Extracts the long value from this DynAny .  The IDL wchar data type is mapped to the Java char data type . 
Adds an AdjustmentListener. Adjustment listeners are notified each time the scrollbar's model changes. Adjustment events are provided for backwards compatibility with java.awt.Scrollbar. Note that the AdjustmentEvents type property will always have a placeholder value of AdjustmentEvent.TRACK because all changes to a BoundedRangeModels value are considered equivalent. To change the value of a BoundedRangeModel one just sets its value property ,  i.e. model.setValue ( 123 ) . No information about the origin of the change ,  e.g. it's a block decrement ,  is provided. We don't try fabricate the origin of the change here.
Moves the focus up one focus traversal cycle from the current focus owner .  Typically ,  the new focus owner is set to the current focus owner's focus cycle root ,  and the current focus cycle root is set to the new focus owner's focus cycle root .  If ,  however ,  the current focus owner's focus cycle root is a Window ,  then typically the focus owner is set to the focus cycle root's default Component to focus ,  and the current focus cycle root is unchanged .

Used to paint the TreeCellRenderer . 
"Gets a PrintJob object which is the result of initiating a print operation on the toolkit's platform .  Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there is a security manager installed .  If there is, the method should call the security manager's checkPrintJobAccess method to ensure initiation of a print operation is allowed .  If the default implementation of checkPrintJobAccess is used (that is, that method is not overriden ) , then this results in a call to the security manager's checkPermission method with a RuntimePermission(""queuePrintJob"" )  permission . "
Returns an array containing the constants of this enum type ,  in the order they are declared .  This method may be used to iterate over the constants as follows: for (AclEntryFlag c : AclEntryFlag . values( )  )  System . out . println(c ) ;
"Returns the length of the duration in milli-seconds. If the seconds field carries more digits than milli-second order ,  those will be simply discarded (or in other words ,  rounded to zero. )  For example ,  for any Date value x ,  new Duration(""PT10.00099S"" ) .getTimeInMills(x )  == 10000. new Duration(""-PT10.00099S"" ) .getTimeInMills(x )  == -10000. Note that this method uses the addTo(Date )  method ,  which may work incorrectly with Duration objects with very large values in its fields. See the addTo(Date )  method for details."
Return a reference to the DOM Node if available
Adds the specified component to this container at the specified index .  This method also notifies the layout manager to add the component to this container's layout using the specified constraints object via the addLayoutComponent method .  The constraints are defined by the particular layout manager being used .  For example ,  the BorderLayout class defines five constraints: BorderLayout . NORTH ,  BorderLayout . SOUTH ,  BorderLayout . EAST ,  BorderLayout . WEST ,  and BorderLayout . CENTER .  The GridBagLayout class requires a GridBagConstraints object .  Failure to pass the correct type of constraints object results in an IllegalArgumentException .  If the current layout manager implements LayoutManager2 ,  then LayoutManager2 . addLayoutComponent ( Component , Object )  is invoked on it .  If the current layout manager does not implement LayoutManager2 ,  and constraints is a String ,  then LayoutManager . addLayoutComponent ( String , Component )  is invoked on it .  If the component is not an ancestor of this container and has a non - null parent ,  it is removed from its current parent before it is added to this container .  This is the method to override if a program needs to track every add request to a container as all other add methods defer to this one .  An overriding method should usually include a call to the superclass's version of the method: super . addImpl ( comp ,  constraints ,  index )  This method changes layout - related information ,  and therefore ,  invalidates the component hierarchy .  If the container has already been displayed ,  the hierarchy must be validated thereafter in order to display the added component . 
Returns the current look and feel or null . 
Returns true if this set contains the specified element. More formally ,  returns true if and only if this set contains an element e such that (o==null ? e==null : o.equals(e )  ) .

Requests that this Component gets the input focus. Refer to Component.requestFocus ( boolean )  for a complete description of this method. Note that the use of this method is discouraged because its behavior is platform dependent. Instead we recommend the use of requestFocusInWindow ( boolean ) . If you would like more information on focus ,  see How to Use the Focus Subsystem ,  a section in The Java Tutorial.
Returns the trigonometric cosine of an angle .  Special cases: If the argument is NaN or an infinity ,  then the result is NaN . 
Handles the windowStateChanged event by invoking the windowStateChanged methods on listener - a and listener - b . 
Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from a subsequence of the given buffers. This operation, sometimes called a gathering write, is often useful when implementing network protocols that group data into segments consisting of one or more fixed - length headers followed by a variable - length body. The handler parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the write operation completes (or fails ) . The result passed to the completion handler is the number of bytes written. This method initiates a write of up to r bytes to this channel, where r is the total number of bytes remaining in the specified subsequence of the given buffer array, that is, srcs [ offset ] .remaining( )  + srcs [ offset+1 ] .remaining( )  + ... + srcs [ offset+length - 1 ] .remaining( )  at the moment that the write is attempted. Suppose that a byte sequence of length n is written, where 0 < n <= r. Up to the first srcs [ offset ] .remaining( )  bytes of this sequence are written from buffer srcs [ offset ] , up to the next srcs [ offset+1 ] .remaining( )  bytes are written from buffer srcs [ offset+1 ] , and so forth, until the entire byte sequence is written. As many bytes as possible are written from each buffer, hence the final position of each updated buffer, except the last updated buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to that buffer's limit. The underlying operating system may impose a limit on the number of buffers that may be used in an I/O operation. Where the number of buffers (with bytes remaining ) , exceeds this limit, then the I/O operation is performed with the maximum number of buffers allowed by the operating system. If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation completes then it completes with the exception InterruptedByTimeoutException. Where a timeout occurs, and the implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been written, or will not be written to the channel from the given buffers, then further attempts to write to the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be thrown.

Get the confirmation options . 
"When concatenated with a class attribute name ,  indicates the format of that attribute ,  using the layout language specified in the JSR 200 specification. For example ,  the effect of this option is built in: pack.class.attribute.SourceFile=RUH. The special strings ERROR ,  STRIP ,  and PASS are also allowed ,  with the same meaning as UNKNOWN _ ATTRIBUTE. This provides a way for users to request that specific attributes be refused ,  stripped ,  or passed bitwise (with no class compression ) . Code like this might be used to support attributes for JCOV: Map p = packer.properties( ) ; p.put(CODE _ ATTRIBUTE _ PFX+""CoverageTable"" ,  ""NH [ PHHII ] "" ) ; p.put(CODE _ ATTRIBUTE _ PFX+""CharacterRangeTable"" ,  ""NH [ PHPOHIIH ] "" ) ; p.put(CLASS _ ATTRIBUTE _ PFX+""SourceID"" ,  ""RUH"" ) ; p.put(CLASS _ ATTRIBUTE _ PFX+""CompilationID"" ,  ""RUH"" ) ; Code like this might be used to strip debugging attributes: Map p = packer.properties( ) ; p.put(CODE _ ATTRIBUTE _ PFX+""LineNumberTable"" ,  STRIP ) ; p.put(CODE _ ATTRIBUTE _ PFX+""LocalVariableTable"" ,  STRIP ) ; p.put(CLASS _ ATTRIBUTE _ PFX+""SourceFile"" ,  STRIP ) ;"

This method is called if the LoginContext's overall authentication failed. (the relevant REQUIRED, REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT and OPTIONAL LoginModules did not succeed ) . If this LoginModule's own authentication attempt succeeded (checked by retrieving the private state saved by the login and commit methods ) , then this method cleans up any state that was originally saved.
Constructs a SpinnerNumberModel with the specified value ,  minimum/maximum bounds ,  and stepSize . 
Waits until all parties have invoked await on this barrier ,  or the specified waiting time elapses .  If the current thread is not the last to arrive then it is disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of the following things happens: The last thread arrives; or The specified timeout elapses; or Some other thread interrupts the current thread; or Some other thread interrupts one of the other waiting threads; or Some other thread times out while waiting for barrier; or Some other thread invokes reset ( ) on this barrier .  If the current thread: has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or is interrupted while waiting then InterruptedException is thrown and the current thread's interrupted status is cleared .  If the specified waiting time elapses then TimeoutException is thrown .  If the time is less than or equal to zero ,  the method will not wait at all .  If the barrier is reset ( ) while any thread is waiting ,  or if the barrier is broken when await is invoked ,  or while any thread is waiting ,  then BrokenBarrierException is thrown .  If any thread is interrupted while waiting ,  then all other waiting threads will throw BrokenBarrierException and the barrier is placed in the broken state .  If the current thread is the last thread to arrive ,  and a non - null barrier action was supplied in the constructor ,  then the current thread runs the action before allowing the other threads to continue .  If an exception occurs during the barrier action then that exception will be propagated in the current thread and the barrier is placed in the broken state . 
The currently marked position in the stream. ByteArrayInputStream objects are marked at position zero by default when constructed. They may be marked at another position within the buffer by the mark( )  method. The current buffer position is set to this point by the reset( )  method. If no mark has been set ,  then the value of mark is the offset passed to the constructor (or 0 if the offset was not supplied ) .
Obtains a soundbank object from the InputStream provided . 
Gets the system default time - zone .  This queries TimeZone . getDefault ( ) to find the default time - zone and converts it to a ZoneId .  If the system default time - zone is changed ,  then the result of this method will also change . 
Returns an iterator object that iterates along the Shape boundary and provides access to a flattened view of the Shape outline geometry .  Only SEG _ MOVETO ,  SEG _ LINETO ,  and SEG _ CLOSE point types are returned by the iterator .  If an optional AffineTransform is specified ,  the coordinates returned in the iteration are transformed accordingly .  The amount of subdivision of the curved segments is controlled by the flatness parameter ,  which specifies the maximum distance that any point on the unflattened transformed curve can deviate from the returned flattened path segments .  Note that a limit on the accuracy of the flattened path might be silently imposed ,  causing very small flattening parameters to be treated as larger values .  This limit ,  if there is one ,  is defined by the particular implementation that is used .  Each call to this method returns a fresh PathIterator object that traverses the Shape object geometry independently from any other PathIterator objects in use at the same time .  It is recommended ,  but not guaranteed ,  that objects implementing the Shape interface isolate iterations that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original object's geometry during such iterations .  The iterator for this class is not multi - threaded safe ,  which means that this Path2D class does not guarantee that modifications to the geometry of this Path2D object do not affect any iterations of that geometry that are already in process .

Returns the cause of this error (the exception that occurred during a static initialization that caused this error to be created ) .
Maps the operation's output RenderContext into a RenderContext for each of the operation's sources .  This is useful for operations that can be expressed in whole or in part simply as alterations in the RenderContext ,  such as an affine mapping ,  or operations that wish to obtain lower quality renderings of their sources in order to save processing effort or transmission bandwith .  Some operations ,  such as blur ,  can also use this mechanism to avoid obtaining sources of higher quality than necessary . 
Returns true if this executor is in the process of terminating after shutdown ( ) or shutdownNow ( ) but has not completely terminated .  This method may be useful for debugging .

If this spliterator can be partitioned ,  returns a Spliterator covering elements ,  that will ,  upon return from this method ,  not be covered by this Spliterator .  If this Spliterator is Spliterator . ORDERED ,  the returned Spliterator must cover a strict prefix of the elements .  Unless this Spliterator covers an infinite number of elements ,  repeated calls to trySplit ( ) must eventually return null .  Upon non - null return: the value reported for estimateSize ( ) before splitting ,  must ,  after splitting ,  be greater than or equal to estimateSize ( ) for this and the returned Spliterator; and if this Spliterator is SUBSIZED ,  then estimateSize ( ) for this spliterator before splitting must be equal to the sum of estimateSize ( ) for this and the returned Spliterator after splitting .  This method may return null for any reason ,  including emptiness ,  inability to split after traversal has commenced ,  data structure constraints ,  and efficiency considerations .

Or ,  if a read lock ,  returns it .  Or ,  if an optimistic read ,  acquires a read lock and returns a read stamp only if immediately available .  This method returns zero in all other cases . 
Sets the designated parameter in this RowSet object's command with the given Java Object. For integral values ,  the java.lang equivalent objects should be used (for example ,  an instance of the class Integer for an int ) . If the second argument is an InputStream then the stream must contain the number of bytes specified by scaleOrLength. If the second argument is a Reader then the reader must contain the number of characters specified * by scaleOrLength. If these conditions are not true the driver will generate a SQLException when the prepared statement is executed. The given Java object will be converted to the targetSqlType before being sent to the database. If the object is of a class implementing SQLData ,  the rowset should call the method SQLData.writeSQL to write the object to an SQLOutput data stream. If ,  on the other hand ,  the object is of a class implementing Ref ,  Blob ,  Clob ,  NClob ,  Struct ,  java.net.URL ,  or Array ,  the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the corresponding SQL type. Note that this method may be used to pass datatabase - specific abstract data types.
Returns the boot class path that is used by the bootstrap class loader to search for class files .  Multiple paths in the boot class path are separated by the path separator character of the platform on which the Java virtual machine is running .  A Java virtual machine implementation may not support the boot class path mechanism for the bootstrap class loader to search for class files .  The isBootClassPathSupported ( ) method can be used to determine if the Java virtual machine supports this method . 
Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in this vector, searching backwards from index, or returns -1 if the element is not found .  More formally, returns the highest index i such that (i <= index && (o==null ? get(i ) ==null : o . equals(get(i )  )  )  ) , or -1 if there is no such index .

Compare this MBeanAttributeInfo to another . 
Inserts an object that intercepts requests for the MBean server that arrive through this connector server .  This object will be supplied as the MBeanServer for any new connection created by this connector server .  Existing connections are unaffected .  This method can be called more than once with different MBeanServerForwarder objects .  The result is a chain of forwarders .  The last forwarder added is the first in the chain .  In more detail: If this connector server is already associated with an MBeanServer object ,  then that object is given to mbsf . setMBeanServer .  If doing so produces an exception ,  this method throws the same exception without any other effect .  If this connector is not already associated with an MBeanServer object ,  or if the mbsf . setMBeanServer call just mentioned succeeds ,  then mbsf becomes this connector server's MBeanServer . 
Set the error handler . 
Determine if the delivered int pixels intersect the region to be extracted and pass through only that subset of pixels that appear in the output region .  Note: This method is intended to be called by the ImageProducer of the Image whose pixels are being filtered .

This is then converted back to a ZonedDateTime ,  using the zone ID to obtain the offset .  When converting back to ZonedDateTime ,  if the local date - time is in an overlap ,  then the offset will be retained if possible ,  otherwise the earlier offset will be used .  If in a gap ,  the local date - time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap .  This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call . 
"Returns an indicator of where the specified point (px,py )  lies with respect to the line segment from (x1,y1 )  to (x2,y2 ) . The return value can be either 1, -1, or 0 and indicates in which direction the specified line must pivot around its first end point, (x1,y1 ) , in order to point at the specified point (px,py ) . A return value of 1 indicates that the line segment must turn in the direction that takes the positive X axis towards the negative Y axis. In the default coordinate system used by Java 2D, this direction is counterclockwise. A return value of -1 indicates that the line segment must turn in the direction that takes the positive X axis towards the positive Y axis. In the default coordinate system, this direction is clockwise. A return value of 0 indicates that the point lies exactly on the line segment. Note that an indicator value of 0 is rare and not useful for determining collinearity because of floating point rounding issues. If the point is colinear with the line segment, but not between the end points, then the value will be -1 if the point lies ""beyond (x1,y1 ) "" or 1 if the point lies ""beyond (x2,y2 ) ""."
The encoding information used in this @charset rule . 
Calculates and returns the bitwise inclusive OR of the status of all media with the specified identifier that are tracked by this media tracker .  Possible flags defined by the MediaTracker class are LOADING ,  ABORTED ,  ERRORED ,  and COMPLETE .  An image that hasn't started loading has zero as its status .

If called multiple times ,  the final invocation takes precedence . 
Invokes the getMinimumSize method on each UI handled by this object . 
Parse an XML document from a system identifier (URI ) . This method is a shortcut for the common case of reading a document from a system identifier. It is the exact equivalent of the following: parse(new InputSource(systemId )  ) ; If the system identifier is a URL ,  it must be fully resolved by the application before it is passed to the parser.

Sets the JPopupMenu for this JComponent .  The UI is responsible for registering bindings and adding the necessary listeners such that the JPopupMenu will be shown at the appropriate time .  When the JPopupMenu is shown depends upon the look and feel: some may show it on a mouse event ,  some may enable a key binding .  If popup is null ,  and getInheritsPopupMenu returns true ,  then getComponentPopupMenu will be delegated to the parent .  This provides for a way to make all child components inherit the popupmenu of the parent .  This is a bound property . 
Called when the UI is being removed from the interface of a JTextComponent .  This is used to unregister any listeners that were attached .

Visits a METHOD executable element by calling defaultAction . 
Returns an MBeanServerConnection object representing a remote MBean server on which operations are performed on behalf of the supplied delegation subject .  For a given JMXConnector and Subject ,  two successful calls to this method will usually return the same MBeanServerConnection object ,  though this is not required .  For each method in the returned MBeanServerConnection ,  calling the method causes the corresponding method to be called in the remote MBean server on behalf of the given delegation subject instead of the authenticated subject .  The value returned by the MBean server method is the value returned to the client .  If the MBean server method produces an Exception ,  the same Exception is seen by the client .  If the MBean server method ,  or the attempt to call it ,  produces an Error ,  the Error is wrapped in a JMXServerErrorException ,  which is seen by the client .

Returns whether the write - half of the socket connection is closed . 
Creates an unbound server socket . 
Reads a file's attributes as a bulk operation. The type parameter is the type of the attributes required and this method returns an instance of that type if supported. All implementations support a basic set of file attributes and so invoking this method with a type parameter of BasicFileAttributes.class will not throw UnsupportedOperationException. The options array may be used to indicate how symbolic links are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default ,  symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target of the link is read. If the option NOFOLLOW _ LINKS is present then symbolic links are not followed. It is implementation specific if all file attributes are read as an atomic operation with respect to other file system operations. Usage Example: Suppose we want to read a file's attributes in bulk: Path path = ... BasicFileAttributes attrs = Files.readAttributes ( path ,  BasicFileAttributes.class ) ; Alternatively ,  suppose we want to read file's POSIX attributes without following symbolic links: PosixFileAttributes attrs = Files.readAttributes ( path ,  PosixFileAttributes.class ,  NOFOLLOW _ LINKS ) ;
Returns the maximum number of items the combo box can display without a scrollbar
Creates a new File instance from a parent pathname string and a child pathname string .  If parent is null then the new File instance is created as if by invoking the single - argument File constructor on the given child pathname string .  Otherwise the parent pathname string is taken to denote a directory ,  and the child pathname string is taken to denote either a directory or a file .  If the child pathname string is absolute then it is converted into a relative pathname in a system - dependent way .  If parent is the empty string then the new File instance is created by converting child into an abstract pathname and resolving the result against a system - dependent default directory .  Otherwise each pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname and the child abstract pathname is resolved against the parent .

"Returns an array of arrays of Annotations that represent the annotations on the formal parameters, in declaration order, of the Executable represented by this object .  Synthetic and mandated parameters (see explanation below ) , such as the outer ""this"" parameter to an inner class constructor will be represented in the returned array .  If the executable has no parameters (meaning no formal, no synthetic, and no mandated parameters ) , a zero - length array will be returned .  If the Executable has one or more parameters, a nested array of length zero is returned for each parameter with no annotations .  The annotation objects contained in the returned arrays are serializable .  The caller of this method is free to modify the returned arrays; it will have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers .  A compiler may add extra parameters that are implicitly declared in source (""mandated"" ) , as well as parameters that are neither implicitly nor explicitly declared in source (""synthetic"" )  to the parameter list for a method .  See Parameter for more information . "
Returns an array of all the listeners which have been associated with the named property . 
Appends the fractional value of a date-time field to the formatter. The fractional value of the field will be output including the preceding decimal point. The preceding value is not output. For example ,  the second-of-minute value of 15 would be output as .25. The width of the printed fraction can be controlled. Setting the minimum width to zero will cause no output to be generated. The printed fraction will have the minimum width necessary between the minimum and maximum widths - trailing zeroes are omitted. No rounding occurs due to the maximum width - digits are simply dropped. When parsing in strict mode ,  the number of parsed digits must be between the minimum and maximum width. When parsing in lenient mode ,  the minimum width is considered to be zero and the maximum is nine. If the value cannot be obtained then an exception will be thrown. If the value is negative an exception will be thrown. If the field does not have a fixed set of valid values then an exception will be thrown. If the field value in the date-time to be printed is invalid it cannot be printed and an exception will be thrown.
Creates a new string reader . 
Convert the string argument into an int value . 
Invokes the update method on each UI handled by this object . 
Deletes the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname .  If this pathname denotes a directory ,  then the directory must be empty in order to be deleted .  Note that the Files class defines the delete method to throw an IOException when a file cannot be deleted .  This is useful for error reporting and to diagnose why a file cannot be deleted . 
Adds all of the elements in the specified set to this attribute .  The outcome is the same as if the = add ( Attribute )  operation had been applied to this attribute set successively with each element from the specified set .  The behavior of the addAll ( AttributeSet )  operation is unspecified if the specified set is modified while the operation is in progress .  If the addAll ( AttributeSet )  operation throws an exception ,  the effect on this attribute set's state is implementation dependent; elements from the specified set before the point of the exception may or may not have been added to this attribute set . 
Converts this BigInteger to a float .  This conversion is similar to the narrowing primitive conversion from double to float as defined in section 5 . 1 . 3 of The Javaâ„¢ Language Specification: if this BigInteger has too great a magnitude to represent as a float ,  it will be converted to Float . NEGATIVE _ INFINITY or Float . POSITIVE _ INFINITY as appropriate .  Note that even when the return value is finite ,  this conversion can lose information about the precision of the BigInteger value . 
A server side ORB calls the establish _ components operation on all registered IORInterceptor instances when it is assembling the list of components that will be included in the profile or profiles of an object reference .  This operation is not necessarily called for each individual object reference .  In the case of the POA ,  this operation is called each time POA::create _ POA is called .  In any case ,  establish _ components is guaranteed to be called at least once for each distinct set of server policies .  An implementation of establish _ components must not throw exceptions .  If it does ,  the ORB shall ignore the exception and proceed to call the next IOR Interceptor's establish _ components operation . 
Checks if this date - time is after the specified date - time ignoring the chronology .  This method differs from the comparison in compareTo ( java . time . chrono . ChronoLocalDateTime < ? >  )  in that it only compares the underlying date - time and not the chronology .  This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based on the time - line position .  This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch - day and nano - of - day . 
Returns a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream after discarding the first n elements of the stream .  If this stream contains fewer than n elements then an empty stream will be returned .  This is a stateful intermediate operation . 
Returns true if a print job is in progress ,  but is going to be cancelled at the next opportunity; otherwise returns false . 
Returns a hash code value for the object .  This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by HashMap .  The general contract of hashCode is: Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application ,  the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer ,  provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified .  This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application .  If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object )  method ,  then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result .  It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the Object . equals(java . lang . Object )  method ,  then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results .  However ,  the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables .  As much as is reasonably practical ,  the hashCode method defined by class Object does return distinct integers for distinct objects .  (This is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer ,  but this implementation technique is not required by the Javaâ„¢ programming language .  ) 
Construct a new media size enumeration value with the given integer value . 
Paints each of the components in this container . 
Interpolation hint value -- the color samples of the 4 nearest neighboring integer coordinate samples in the image are interpolated linearly to produce a color sample .  Conceptually the image is viewed as a set of infinitely small point color samples which have value only at the centers of integer coordinate pixels and the space between those pixel centers is filled with linear ramps of colors that connect adjacent discrete samples in a straight line .  As the image is scaled up ,  there are no blocky edges between the colors in the image as there are with NEAREST _ NEIGHBOR ,  but the blending may show some subtle discontinuities along the horizontal and vertical edges that line up with the samples caused by a sudden change in the slope of the interpolation from one side of a sample to the other .  As the image is scaled down ,  more image pixels have their color samples represented in the resulting output since each output pixel receives color information from up to 4 image pixels . 
Returns true if this deque contains the specified element. More formally ,  returns true if and only if this deque contains at least one element e such that (o==null ? e==null : o.equals(e )  ) .
Used by the ORB to obtain complete type information from the servant .

Return the user's group identification number (GID )  for this SolarisNumericGroupPrincipal as a long . 
Creates a set of offset/span pairs representing how to lay out a set of components end - to - end .  This method requires that you specify the total amount of space to be allocated, the size requirements for each component to be placed (specified as an array of SizeRequirements ) , and the total size requirement of the set of components .  You can get the total size requirement by invoking the getTiledSizeRequirements method .  The components will be tiled in the forward direction with offsets increasing from 0 . 
Returns the value of the specified number as a float ,  which may involve rounding . 
Create a document type definition event This string contains the entire document type declaration that matches the doctypedecl in the XML 1 . 0 specification
Performs a timed Object.wait using this time unit. This is a convenience method that converts timeout arguments into the form required by the Object.wait method. For example ,  you could implement a blocking poll method (see BlockingQueue.poll )  using: public synchronized Object poll(long timeout ,  TimeUnit unit )  throws InterruptedException { while (empty )  { unit.timedWait(this ,  timeout ) ; ... } }
Search one level of the named context .  The NamingEnumeration that results from search ( ) using ONELEVEL _ SCOPE contains elements with objects in the named context that satisfy the search filter specified in search ( ) .  The names of elements in the NamingEnumeration are atomic names relative to the named context .  The value of this constant is 1 .

The vector containing the real UIs .  This is populated in the call to createUI ,  and can be obtained by calling the getUIs method .  The first element is guaranteed to be the real UI obtained from the default look and feel . 
Returns an array of all the objects currently registered as FooListeners upon this List .  FooListeners are registered using the addFooListener method .  You can specify the listenerType argument with a class literal ,  such as FooListener . class .  For example ,  you can query a List l for its item listeners with the following code: ItemListener [ ] ils = (ItemListener [ ] ) (l . getListeners(ItemListener . class )  ) ; If no such listeners exist ,  this method returns an empty array . 
See the widows property definition in CSS2 . 
Returns a string describing this PermissionCollection object ,  providing information about all the permissions it contains .  The format is: super . toString() ( // enumerate all the Permission // objects and call toString() on them ,  // one per line .  .  ) super . toString is a call to the toString method of this object's superclass ,  which is Object .  The result is this PermissionCollection's type name followed by this object's hashcode ,  thus enabling clients to differentiate different PermissionCollections object ,  even if they contain the same permissions . 
"Obtain a new instance of a TransformerFactory .  This static method creates a new factory instance .  This method uses the following ordered lookup procedure to determine the TransformerFactory implementation class to load: Use the javax . xml . transform . TransformerFactory system property .  Use the properties file ""lib/jaxp . properties"" in the JRE directory .  This configuration file is in standard java . util . Properties format and contains the fully qualified name of the implementation class with the key being the system property defined above .  The jaxp . properties file is read only once by the JAXP implementation and it's values are then cached for future use .  If the file does not exist when the first attempt is made to read from it ,  no further attempts are made to check for its existence .  It is not possible to change the value of any property in jaxp . properties after it has been read for the first time .  Use the service - provider loading facilities ,  defined by the ServiceLoader class ,  to attempt to locate and load an implementation of the service using the default loading mechanism: the service - provider loading facility will use the current thread's context class loader to attempt to load the service .  If the context class loader is null ,  the system class loader will be used .  Otherwise ,  the system - default implementation is returned .  Once an application has obtained a reference to a TransformerFactory it can use the factory to configure and obtain transformer instances . "

Returns the TabStop at index index .  This will throw an IllegalArgumentException if index is outside the range of tabs . 
cdata - section - elements = expanded names .  cdata - section - elements specifies a whitespace delimited list of the names of elements whose text node children should be output using CDATA sections .  Note that these names must use the format described in the section Qualfied Name Representation in javax . xml . transform . 
Handles the windowDeactivated event by invoking the windowDeactivated methods on listener - a and listener - b . 
Constructs a StartTLS extended response .  A concrete subclass must have a public no - arg constructor . 
If this Window is visible ,  sends this Window to the back and may cause it to lose focus or activation if it is the focused or active Window .  Places this Window at the bottom of the stacking order and shows it behind any other Windows in this VM .  No action will take place is this Window is not visible .  Some platforms do not allow Windows which are owned by other Windows to appear below their owners .  Every attempt will be made to move this Window as low as possible in the stacking order; however ,  developers should not assume that this method will move this Window below all other windows in every situation .  Because of variations in native windowing systems ,  no guarantees about changes to the focused and active Windows can be made .  Developers must never assume that this Window is no longer the focused or active Window until this Window receives a WINDOW _ LOST _ FOCUS or WINDOW _ DEACTIVATED event .  On platforms where the top - most window is the focused window ,  this method will probably cause this Window to lose focus .  In that case ,  the next highest ,  focusable Window in this VM will receive focus .  On platforms where the stacking order does not typically affect the focused window ,  this method will probably leave the focused and active Windows unchanged . 
Returns the Adjustable object where this event originated . 
Returns the first selected index or -1 if the selection is empty . 
Sets the target object for this relation
Configures the specified component appropriately for the look and feel .  This method is invoked when the ComponentUI instance is being installed as the UI delegate on the specified component .  This method should completely configure the component for the look and feel ,  including the following: Install default property values for color ,  fonts ,  borders ,  icons ,  opacity ,  etc .  on the component .  Whenever possible ,  property values initialized by the client program should not be overridden .  Install a LayoutManager on the component if necessary .  Create/add any required sub - components to the component .  Create/install event listeners on the component .  Create/install a PropertyChangeListener on the component in order to detect and respond to component property changes appropriately .  Install keyboard UI (mnemonics ,  traversal ,  etc .  )  on the component .  Initialize any appropriate instance data . 
Writes a single character . 
Return an attribute's qualified (prefixed )  name . 
Reports whether this driver is a genuine JDBC Compliantâ„¢ driver .  A driver may only report true here if it passes the JDBC compliance tests; otherwise it is required to return false .  JDBC compliance requires full support for the JDBC API and full support for SQL 92 Entry Level .  It is expected that JDBC compliant drivers will be available for all the major commercial databases .  This method is not intended to encourage the development of non - JDBC compliant drivers ,  but is a recognition of the fact that some vendors are interested in using the JDBC API and framework for lightweight databases that do not support full database functionality ,  or for special databases such as document information retrieval where a SQL implementation may not be feasible . 
Returns the name of the L&F class that renders this component . 
Translates a string from Unicode to ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE ) , as defined by the ToASCII operation of RFC 3490 .  This convenience method works as if by invoking the two - argument counterpart as follows: toASCII(input, 0 ) ;

Returns a string representation of this JComboBox .  This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes ,  and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations .  The returned string may be empty but may not be null . 
Initializes the struct data value associated with a DynStruct object from a sequence of NameDynAnyPairs .  The operation sets the current position to zero if the passed sequences has non-zero length .  Otherwise ,  if an empty sequence is passed ,  the current position is set to -1 .  Members must appear in the NameDynAnyPairs in the order in which they appear in the IDL specification of the struct as indicated by the DynStruct's TypeCode or they must be empty strings .  The operation makes no attempt to assign member values based on member names . 
Constructs a newly allocated Double object that represents the floating - point value of type double represented by the string .  The string is converted to a double value as if by the valueOf method . 
Creates a Constraints object with the specified values for its x ,  y ,  width ,  and height properties .  Note: If the SpringLayout class encounters null values in the Constraints object of a given component ,  it replaces them with suitable defaults . 
Paints the specified component .  This implementation does nothing . 
Constant used to determine when the accessibleStateSet property has changed .  The old value will be the old AccessibleState and the new value will be the new AccessibleState in the accessibleStateSet .  For example ,  if a component that supports the vertical and horizontal states changes its orientation from vertical to horizontal ,  the old value will be AccessibleState . VERTICAL and the new value will be AccessibleState . HORIZONTAL .  Please note that either value can also be null .  For example ,  when a component changes from being enabled to disabled ,  the old value will be AccessibleState . ENABLED and the new value will be null . 
Returns the offset after the last character matched . 
Indicates that the column stores results .  A possible value for the column COLUMN _ TYPE in the ResultSet returned by the method getProcedureColumns . 
Generates a private key object from the provided key specification (key material ) .

Name of the Action for moving the caret to the beginning of the next word . 
Tests if the interior of the Shape entirely contains the specified rectangular area .  All coordinates that lie inside the rectangular area must lie within the Shape for the entire rectangular area to be considered contained within the Shape .  The Shape . contains ( ) method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return false when: the intersect method returns true and the calculations to determine whether or not the Shape entirely contains the rectangular area are prohibitively expensive .  This means that for some Shapes this method might return false even though the Shape contains the rectangular area .  The Area class performs more accurate geometric computations than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required . 
Returns the color used to draw the foreground of selected items .  DefaultListCellRenderer uses this color to draw the foreground of items in the selected state ,  as do the renderers installed by most ListUI implementations . 
Invokes the getPreferredSize method on each UI handled by this object . 
"Justification .  Table tag ""JSTF"" in the Open Type Specification . "

Fetches an attribute constant for a well - known attribute name (i.e. one of the attributes in the set {FACE ,  COMMENT ,  SIZE ,  COLOR ,  CLEAR ,  BACKGROUND ,  BGCOLOR ,  TEXT ,  LINK ,  VLINK ,  ALINK ,  WIDTH ,  HEIGHT ,  ALIGN ,  NAME ,  HREF ,  REL ,  REV ,  TITLE ,  TARGET ,  SHAPE ,  COORDS ,  ISMAP ,  NOHREF ,  ALT ,  ID ,  SRC ,  HSPACE ,  VSPACE ,  USEMAP ,  LOWSRC ,  CODEBASE ,  CODE ,  ARCHIVE ,  VALUE ,  VALUETYPE ,  TYPE ,  CLASS ,  STYLE ,  LANG ,  DIR ,  DECLARE ,  CLASSID ,  DATA ,  CODETYPE ,  STANDBY ,  BORDER ,  SHAPES ,  NOSHADE ,  COMPACT ,  START ,  ACTION ,  METHOD ,  ENCTYPE ,  CHECKED ,  MAXLENGTH ,  MULTIPLE ,  SELECTED ,  ROWS ,  COLS ,  DUMMY ,  CELLSPACING ,  CELLPADDING ,  VALIGN ,  HALIGN ,  NOWRAP ,  ROWSPAN ,  COLSPAN ,  PROMPT ,  HTTPEQUIV ,  CONTENT ,  LANGUAGE ,  VERSION ,  N ,  FRAMEBORDER ,  MARGINWIDTH ,  MARGINHEIGHT ,  SCROLLING ,  NORESIZE ,  MEDIA ,  ENDTAG} ) . If the given name does not represent one of the well - known attributes ,  then null will be returned.
Sets the username property for this RowSet object to the given user name .  Because it is not serialized ,  the username property is set at run time before calling the method execute . 
Starts playing this audio clip .  Each time this method is called ,  the clip is restarted from the beginning . 
Last path that was added . 
Returns the hash code of this TreePath .  The hash code of a TreePath is the hash code of the last element in the path . 
Updates the designated column using the given Reader object ,  which is the given number of characters long .  When a very large UNICODE value is input to a LONGVARCHAR parameter ,  it may be more practical to send it via a java . io . Reader object .  The JDBC driver will do any necessary conversion from UNICODE to the database char format .  The updater methods are used to update column values in the current row or the insert row .  The updater methods do not update the underlying database; instead the updateRow or insertRow methods are called to update the database . 
Gives access to a buffer that can be used to fetch text from the associated document . 
Constructs an OpenMBeanAttributeInfoSupport instance ,  which describes the attribute of an open MBean with the specified name ,  openType ,  description and defaultValue ,  and the specified read/write access properties . 
Gets the bounds of this object in the form of a Rectangle object .  The bounds specify this object's width ,  height ,  and location relative to its parent . 
Relative bulk put method (optional operation ) . This method transfers chars from the given string into this buffer. If there are more chars to be copied from the string than remain in this buffer, that is, if end - start > remaining( ) , then no chars are transferred and a BufferOverflowException is thrown. Otherwise, this method copies n = end - start chars from the given string into this buffer, starting at the given start index and at the current position of this buffer. The position of this buffer is then incremented by n. In other words, an invocation of this method of the form dst.put(src, start, end )  has exactly the same effect as the loop for (int i = start; i < end; i++ )  dst.put(src.charAt(i )  ) ; except that it first checks that there is sufficient space in this buffer and it is potentially much more efficient.
The public identifier associated with the entity if specified ,  and null otherwise . 
Obtains a local date in this chronology from another temporal object .  This obtains a date in this chronology based on the specified temporal .  A TemporalAccessor represents an arbitrary set of date and time information ,  which this factory converts to an instance of ChronoLocalDate .  The conversion typically uses the EPOCH _ DAY field ,  which is standardized across calendar systems .  This method matches the signature of the functional interface TemporalQuery allowing it to be used as a query via method reference ,  aChronology::date . 
Adds a point ,  specified by the integer arguments newx , newy to the bounds of this Rectangle .  If this Rectangle has any dimension less than zero ,  the rules for non - existant rectangles apply .  In that case ,  the new bounds of this Rectangle will have a location equal to the specified coordinates and width and height equal to zero .  After adding a point ,  a call to contains with the added point as an argument does not necessarily return true .  The contains method does not return true for points on the right or bottom edges of a Rectangle .  Therefore ,  if the added point falls on the right or bottom edge of the enlarged Rectangle ,  contains returns false for that point .  If the specified point must be contained within the new Rectangle ,  a 1x1 rectangle should be added instead: r . add ( newx ,  newy ,  1 ,  1 ) ;
Constructs a MidiUnavailableException that has null as its error detail message . 
Determines whether or not the root node from the TreeModel is visible . 
Get the user - friendly name of this plug - in . 
This method always returns false for unresolved permissions .  That is ,  an UnresolvedPermission is never considered to imply another permission . 
Adds a component to the tabbed pane .  If constraints is a String or an Icon ,  it will be used for the tab title ,  otherwise the component's name will be used as the tab title .  Cover method for insertTab . 
Sets the designated parameter to the given Reader object .  When a very large UNICODE value is input to a LONGVARCHAR parameter ,  it may be more practical to send it via a java . io . Reader object .  The data will be read from the stream as needed until end - of - file is reached .  The JDBC driver will do any necessary conversion from UNICODE to the database char format .  Note: This stream object can either be a standard Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the standard interface .  Note: Consult your JDBC driver documentation to determine if it might be more efficient to use a version of setCharacterStream which takes a length parameter . 
Returns a BigInteger whose value is ( - this ) .
"The character encoding to use for the output .  The encoding must be a string acceptable for an XML encoding declaration ([XML 1 . 0 ]  section 4 . 3 . 3 ""Character Encoding in Entities"" ) , it is recommended that character encodings registered (as charsets )  with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority [IANA - CHARSETS ]  should be referred to using their registered names . "
Creates the container to manage placement of editingComponent . 
Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if this list does not contain the element .  More formally, returns the highest index i such that (o==null ? get(i ) ==null : o . equals(get(i )  )  ) , or -1 if there is no such index . 
Returns the type of state change (selected or deselected ) .
Returns the algorithm that was used to seal this object . 
Returns an input stream for reading the contents of the specified zip file entry . 
Returns data for a single pixel in a primitive array of type TransferType .  For a SinglePixelPackedSampleModel, the array will have one element, and the type will be the same as the storage data type .  Generally, obj should be passed in as null, so that the Object will be created automatically and will be of the right primitive data type .  The following code illustrates transferring data for one pixel from DataBuffer db1, whose storage layout is described by SinglePixelPackedSampleModel sppsm1, to DataBuffer db2, whose storage layout is described by SinglePixelPackedSampleModel sppsm2 .  The transfer will generally be more efficient than using getPixel/setPixel .  SinglePixelPackedSampleModel sppsm1, sppsm2; DataBufferInt db1, db2; sppsm2 . setDataElements ( x, y, sppsm1 . getDataElements ( x, y, null, db1 ) , db2 ) ; Using getDataElements/setDataElements to transfer between two DataBuffer/SampleModel pairs is legitimate if the SampleModels have the same number of bands, corresponding bands have the same number of bits per sample, and the TransferTypes are the same .  If obj is non - null, it should be a primitive array of type TransferType .  Otherwise, a ClassCastException is thrown .  An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException may be thrown if the coordinates are not in bounds, or if obj is non - null and is not large enough to hold the pixel data . 
"Sets whether this Window should appear at the default location for the native windowing system or at the current location (returned by getLocation )  the next time the Window is made visible .  This behavior resembles a native window shown without programmatically setting its location .  Most windowing systems cascade windows if their locations are not explicitly set .  The actual location is determined once the window is shown on the screen .  This behavior can also be enabled by setting the System Property ""java . awt . Window . locationByPlatform"" to ""true"" ,  though calls to this method take precedence .  Calls to setVisible ,  setLocation and setBounds after calling setLocationByPlatform clear this property of the Window .  For example ,  after the following code is executed: setLocationByPlatform(true ) ; setVisible(true ) ; boolean flag = isLocationByPlatform( ) ; The window will be shown at platform's default location and flag will be false .  In the following sample: setLocationByPlatform(true ) ; setLocation(10 ,  10 ) ; boolean flag = isLocationByPlatform( ) ; setVisible(true ) ; The window will be shown at (10 ,  10 )  and flag will be false . "
Inserts a string of content .  This will cause a DocumentEvent of type DocumentEvent . EventType . INSERT to be sent to the registered DocumentListers ,  unless an exception is thrown .  The DocumentEvent will be delivered by calling the insertUpdate method on the DocumentListener .  The offset and length of the generated DocumentEvent will indicate what change was actually made to the Document .  If the Document structure changed as result of the insertion ,  the details of what Elements were inserted and removed in response to the change will also be contained in the generated DocumentEvent .  It is up to the implementation of a Document to decide how the structure should change in response to an insertion .  If the Document supports undo/redo ,  an UndoableEditEvent will also be generated . 
Specifies the ledger size ,  11 inches by 17 inches . 
Returns the current x coordinate of the component's origin .  This method is preferable to writing component . getBounds ( ) . x ,  or component . getLocation ( ) . x because it doesn't cause any heap allocations . 
Return this slider's vertical or horizontal orientation . 
"Returns a string representation of this collection. The string representation consists of a list of the collection's elements in the order they are returned by its iterator ,  enclosed in square brackets ("" [ ]"" ) . Adjacent elements are separated by the characters "" ,  "" (comma and space ) . Elements are converted to strings as by String.valueOf(Object ) ."
Updates the designated column using the given Reader object ,  which is the given number of characters long .  When a very large UNICODE value is input to a LONGVARCHAR parameter ,  it may be more practical to send it via a java . io . Reader object .  The JDBC driver will do any necessary conversion from UNICODE to the database char format .  The updater methods are used to update column values in the current row or the insert row .  The updater methods do not update the underlying database; instead the updateRow or insertRow methods are called to update the database . 
Returns an object - valued Stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream .  This is an intermediate operation . 
Compiles the script (source read from Reader )  for later execution .  Functionality is identical to compile(String )  other than the way in which the source is passed . 
Called when an object has been added .  The binding of the newly added object can be obtained using evt . getNewBinding ( ) . 
Constructs a solid BasicStroke with the specified attributes . 
Returns the specified component's maximum size appropriate for the look and feel. If null is returned ,  the maximum size will be calculated by the component's layout manager instead (this is the preferred approach for any component with a specific layout manager installed ) . The default implementation of this method invokes getPreferredSize and returns that value.
Creates a new tool bar with the specified name .  The name is used as the title of the undocked tool bar .  The default orientation is HORIZONTAL . 
PropertyChangeListener returned from createPropertyChangeListener .  You should not need to access this field ,  rather if you want to customize the PropertyChangeListener override createPropertyChangeListener . 
"Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue ,  in proper sequence. The returned array will be ""safe"" in that no references to it are maintained by this queue. (In other words ,  this method must allocate a new array ) . The caller is thus free to modify the returned array. This method acts as bridge between array - based and collection - based APIs."
Fetches the name of the style .  A style is not required to be named ,  so null is returned if there is no name associated with the style . 
Copies or connects an array of objects .  Used by local stubs to copy any number of actual parameters ,  preserving sharing across parameters as necessary to support RMI semantics . 
Constructs a new JTextArea with the specified number of rows and columns ,  and the given model .  All of the constructors feed through this constructor . 
"Returns the current thread's ""initial value"" for this thread - local variable .  This method will be invoked the first time a thread accesses the variable with the get ( ) method ,  unless the thread previously invoked the set ( T) method ,  in which case the initialValue method will not be invoked for the thread .  Normally ,  this method is invoked at most once per thread ,  but it may be invoked again in case of subsequent invocations of remove ( ) followed by get ( ) .  This implementation simply returns null; if the programmer desires thread - local variables to have an initial value other than null ,  ThreadLocal must be subclassed ,  and this method overridden .  Typically ,  an anonymous inner class will be used . "
Relative put method (optional operation ) . Writes the given long into this buffer at the current position ,  and then increments the position.
This property is a numeral giving the estimated target size N (in bytes )  of each archive segment. If a single input file requires more than N bytes ,  it will be given its own archive segment. As a special case ,  a value of -1 will produce a single large segment with all input files ,  while a value of 0 will produce one segment for each class. Larger archive segments result in less fragmentation and better compression ,  but processing them requires more memory. The size of each segment is estimated by counting the size of each input file to be transmitted in the segment ,  along with the size of its name and other transmitted properties. The default is -1 ,  which means the packer will always create a single segment output file. In cases where extremely large output files are generated ,  users are strongly encouraged to use segmenting or break up the input file into smaller JARs. A 10Mb JAR packed without this limit will typically pack about 10% smaller ,  but the packer may require a larger Java heap (about ten times the segment limit ) .
Removes an observer .  If the observer was not registered ,  nothing happens .  If the observer was registered for multiple notifications ,  it will now be registered for one fewer . 
Constructs an ImageTypeSpecifier from a RenderedImage .  If a BufferedImage is being used ,  one of the factory methods createFromRenderedImage or createFromBufferedImageType should be used instead in order to get a more accurate result . 
DONE is returned by previous ( ) ,  next ( ) ,  next ( int) ,  preceding ( int) and following ( int) when either the first or last text boundary has been reached . 
When a TemplatesHandler object is used as a ContentHandler for the parsing of transformation instructions ,  it creates a Templates object ,  which the caller can get once the SAX events have been completed . 
Reads data from istream and initalizes the value field of the Holder with the unmarshalled data . 
Instantiates and registers an MBean in the MBean server. The class loader to be used is identified by its object name. An object name is associated with the MBean. If the object name of the loader is null ,  the ClassLoader that loaded the MBean server will be used. If the MBean's object name given is null ,  the MBean must provide its own name by implementing the MBeanRegistration interface and returning the name from the preRegister method. This method is equivalent to createMBean(className ,  name ,  loaderName ,  (Object [ ] )  null ,  (String [ ] )  null ) .
Tries to move the position of the caret from the coordinates of a mouse event ,  using viewToModel ( ) .  This will cause a selection if the dot and mark are different . 
Inserts all of the elements in the specified collection into this list ,  starting at the specified position. Shifts the element currently at that position (if any )  and any subsequent elements to the right (increases their indices ) . The new elements will appear in the list in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's iterator.
Returns the underlying element . 
Returns annotations that are present on this element .  If there are no annotations present on this element ,  the return value is an array of length 0 .  The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers . 
Converts this date - time to an Instant .  This returns an Instant representing the same point on the time - line as this date - time . 
Generates a key pair .  If this KeyPairGenerator has not been initialized explicitly ,  provider - specific defaults will be used for the size and other (algorithm - specific )  values of the generated keys .  This will generate a new key pair every time it is called .  This method is functionally equivalent to generateKeyPair . 
Sets the font for this component . 
ISO B3 size . 
"The MGF1ParameterSpec which uses ""SHA - 384"" message digest . "
Returns a position that represents the end of the document .  The position returned can be counted on to track change and stay located at the end of the document . 
Converts this date - time to an Instant .  This combines this local date - time and the specified offset to form an Instant .  This default implementation calculates from the epoch - day of the date and the second - of - day of the time . 
Sets the maximum file length for the file .  A JNLP client may enforce restrictions on setting the maximum file length .  A JNLP client should not truncate a file if the maximum file length is set that is less than the current file size ,  but it also should not allow further writes to that file . 
Tests for equality between the specified object and this object .  Two SecretKeySpec objects are considered equal if they are both SecretKey instances which have the same case - insensitive algorithm name and key encoding . 
Creates and executes a ScheduledFuture that becomes enabled after the given delay . 
Constructs a new URI by parsing the given string and then resolving it against this URI. This convenience method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the expression resolve ( URI.create ( str )  ) .

Sets the maximum number of entries to be returned as a result of the search .  0 indicates no limit: all entries will be returned . 
Sets the location of the object relative to the parent . 
Return a PermissionCollection object containing the set of permissions granted to the specified ProtectionDomain .  Applications are discouraged from calling this method since this operation may not be supported by all policy implementations .  Applications should rely on the implies method to perform policy checks .  The default implementation of this method first retrieves the permissions returned via getPermissions(CodeSource )  (the CodeSource is taken from the specified ProtectionDomain ) , as well as the permissions located inside the specified ProtectionDomain .  All of these permissions are then combined and returned in a new PermissionCollection object .  If getPermissions(CodeSource )  returns Policy . UNSUPPORTED _ EMPTY _ COLLECTION, then this method returns the permissions contained inside the specified ProtectionDomain in a new PermissionCollection object .  This method can be overridden if the policy implementation supports returning a set of permissions granted to a ProtectionDomain . 
Constructs a new JDIPermission object . 
Retrieves the change information for this event .  The value of the change information is service - specific .  For example ,  it could be an ID that identifies the change in a change log on the server . 
Sets the current URL being displayed .  The content type of the pane is set ,  and if the editor kit for the pane is non - null ,  then a new default document is created and the URL is read into it .  If the URL contains and reference location ,  the location will be scrolled to by calling the scrollToReference method .  If the desired URL is the one currently being displayed ,  the document will not be reloaded .  To force a document reload it is necessary to clear the stream description property of the document .  The following code shows how this can be done: Document doc = jEditorPane . getDocument ( ); doc . putProperty ( Document . StreamDescriptionProperty ,  null); If the desired URL is not the one currently being displayed ,  the getStream method is called to give subclasses control over the stream provided .  This may load either synchronously or asynchronously depending upon the document returned by the EditorKit .  If the Document is of type AbstractDocument and has a value returned by AbstractDocument . getAsynchronousLoadPriority that is greater than or equal to zero ,  the page will be loaded on a separate thread using that priority .  If the document is loaded synchronously ,  it will be filled in with the stream prior to being installed into the editor with a call to setDocument ,  which is bound and will fire a property change event .  If an IOException is thrown the partially loaded document will be discarded and neither the document or page property change events will be fired .  If the document is successfully loaded and installed ,  a view will be built for it by the UI which will then be scrolled if necessary ,  and then the page property change event will be fired .  If the document is loaded asynchronously ,  the document will be installed into the editor immediately using a call to setDocument which will fire a document property change event ,  then a thread will be created which will begin doing the actual loading .  In this case ,  the page property change event will not be fired by the call to this method directly ,  but rather will be fired when the thread doing the loading has finished .  It will also be fired on the event - dispatch thread .  Since the calling thread can not throw an IOException in the event of failure on the other thread ,  the page property change event will be fired when the other thread is done whether the load was successful or not .

Returns an array of the values of the items whose names are specified by keys ,  in the same order as keys . 
Returns a unique instance of an ImageFilter object which will actually perform the filtering for the specified ImageConsumer .  The default implementation just clones this object .  Note: This method is intended to be called by the ImageProducer of the Image whose pixels are being filtered .  Developers using this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling this method directly since that operation could interfere with the filtering operation . 
Adds the specified SingleInstanceListener to handle how the application/applet should behave when another instance of the same application/applet is invoked .  If SingleInstanceListener sil is null ,  no exception is thrown and no action is performed . 
Returns the specified component's preferred size appropriate for the look and feel. If null is returned ,  the preferred size will be calculated by the component's layout manager instead (this is the preferred approach for any component with a specific layout manager installed ) .

The scrollUnderway flag is used for components like JList. When the downarrow key is pressed on a JList and the selected cell is the last in the list ,  the scrollpane autoscrolls. Here ,  the old selected cell needs repainting and so we need a flag to make the viewport do the optimized painting only when there is an explicit call to setViewPosition ( Point ) . When setBounds is called through other routes ,  the flag is off and the view repaints normally. Another approach would be to remove this from the JViewport class and have the JList manage this case by using setBackingStoreEnabled. The default is false.
Default constructor . 
Returns the hash code value for this OpenMBeanInfoSupport instance. The hash code of an OpenMBeanInfoSupport instance is the sum of the hash codes of all elements of information used in equals comparisons (ie: its class name, and its infos on attributes, constructors, operations and notifications, where the hashCode of each of these arrays is calculated by a call to new java.util.HashSet(java.util.Arrays.asList(this.getSignature )  ) .hashCode( )  ) . This ensures that t1.equals(t2 )  implies that t1.hashCode( ) ==t2.hashCode( )  for any two OpenMBeanInfoSupport instances t1 and t2, as required by the general contract of the method Object.hashCode( ) . However, note that another instance of a class implementing the OpenMBeanInfo interface may be equal to this OpenMBeanInfoSupport instance as defined by equals(java.lang.Object ) , but may have a different hash code if it is calculated differently. As OpenMBeanInfoSupport instances are immutable, the hash code for this instance is calculated once, on the first call to hashCode, and then the same value is returned for subsequent calls.

Writes the given Java String to the CLOB value that this Clob object designates at the position pos .  The string will overwrite the existing characters in the Clob object starting at the position pos .  If the end of the Clob value is reached while writing the given string ,  then the length of the Clob value will be increased to accommodate the extra characters .  Note: If the value specified for pos is greater then the length+1 of the CLOB value then the behavior is undefined .  Some JDBC drivers may throw a SQLException while other drivers may support this operation . 
Used for instances of EndElementTree representing the start of an HTML element . 
Returns this pipe's source channel . 
Returns the floating-point value adjacent to d in the direction of negative infinity .  This method is semantically equivalent to nextAfter ( d ,  Double . NEGATIVE _ INFINITY ) ; however ,  a nextDown implementation may run faster than its equivalent nextAfter call .  Special Cases: If the argument is NaN ,  the result is NaN .  If the argument is negative infinity ,  the result is negative infinity .  If the argument is zero ,  the result is -Double . MIN _ VALUE
Returns the hash code value for this OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instance. The hash code of an OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instance is the sum of the hash codes of all elements of information used in equals comparisons (ie: its name and signature, where the signature hashCode is calculated by a call to java.util.Arrays.asList(this.getSignature ) .hashCode( )  ) . This ensures that t1.equals(t2 )  implies that t1.hashCode( ) ==t2.hashCode( )  for any two OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instances t1 and t2, as required by the general contract of the method Object.hashCode( ) . However, note that another instance of a class implementing the OpenMBeanConstructorInfo interface may be equal to this OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instance as defined by equals(java.lang.Object ) , but may have a different hash code if it is calculated differently. As OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instances are immutable, the hash code for this instance is calculated once, on the first call to hashCode, and then the same value is returned for subsequent calls.

Causes a transfer from the given component to the given clipboard .  This method is called by the default cut and copy actions registered in a component's action map .  The transfer will take place using the java . awt . datatransfer mechanism ,  requiring no further effort from the developer .  Any data transfer will be complete and the exportDone method will be called with the action that occurred ,  before this method returns .  Should the clipboard be unavailable when attempting to place data on it ,  the IllegalStateException thrown by Clipboard . setContents ( Transferable ,  ClipboardOwner )  will be propagated through this method .  However ,  exportDone will first be called with an action of NONE for consistency .

Returns the currently set Action for this ActionEvent source ,  or null if no Action is set . 
Allow the application to resolve external entities. The parser will call this method before opening any external entity except the top - level document entity. Such entities include the external DTD subset and external parameter entities referenced within the DTD (in either case, only if the parser reads external parameter entities ) , and external general entities referenced within the document element (if the parser reads external general entities ) . The application may request that the parser locate the entity itself, that it use an alternative URI, or that it use data provided by the application (as a character or byte input stream ) . Application writers can use this method to redirect external system identifiers to secure and/or local URIs, to look up public identifiers in a catalogue, or to read an entity from a database or other input source (including, for example, a dialog box ) . Neither XML nor SAX specifies a preferred policy for using public or system IDs to resolve resources. However, SAX specifies how to interpret any InputSource returned by this method, and that if none is returned, then the system ID will be dereferenced as a URL. If the system identifier is a URL, the SAX parser must resolve it fully before reporting it to the application.
Implements the keys method as per the specification in Preferences . keys ( ) .  This implementation obtains this preference node's lock ,  checks that the node has not been removed and invokes keysSpi ( ) . 
"Returns a string describing this Method ,  including type parameters .  The string is formatted as the method access modifiers ,  if any ,  followed by an angle - bracketed comma - separated list of the method's type parameters ,  if any ,  followed by the method's generic return type ,  followed by a space ,  followed by the class declaring the method ,  followed by a period ,  followed by the method name ,  followed by a parenthesized ,  comma - separated list of the method's generic formal parameter types .  If this method was declared to take a variable number of arguments ,  instead of denoting the last parameter as ""Type [ ]"" ,  it is denoted as ""Type .  .  . "" .  A space is used to separate access modifiers from one another and from the type parameters or return type .  If there are no type parameters ,  the type parameter list is elided; if the type parameter list is present ,  a space separates the list from the class name .  If the method is declared to throw exceptions ,  the parameter list is followed by a space ,  followed by the word throws followed by a comma - separated list of the generic thrown exception types .  The access modifiers are placed in canonical order as specified by ""The Java Language Specification"" .  This is public ,  protected or private first ,  and then other modifiers in the following order: abstract ,  default ,  static ,  final ,  synchronized ,  native ,  strictfp . "

Attaches to a Java virtual machine. A Java virtual machine is identified by an abstract identifier. The nature of this identifier is platform dependent but in many cases it will be the string representation of the process identifier (or pid ) . This method parses the identifier and maps the identifier to a Java virtual machine (in an implementation dependent manner ) . If the identifier cannot be parsed by the provider then an AttachNotSupportedException is thrown. Once parsed this method attempts to attach to the Java virtual machine. If the provider detects that the identifier corresponds to a Java virtual machine that does not exist ,  or it corresponds to a Java virtual machine that does not support the attach mechanism implemented by this provider ,  or it detects that the Java virtual machine is a version to which this provider cannot attach ,  then an AttachNotSupportedException is thrown.
This implementation calls defaultAction . 
Unsets the designated column as the match column for this RowSet object .  RowSet objects that implement the Joinable interface must ensure that a key - like constraint continues to be enforced until the method CachedRowSet . unsetKeyColumns has been called on the designated column . 
Gets the value of the specified field from this month - day as an int .  This queries this month - day for the value of the specified field .  The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field .  If it is not possible to return the value ,  because the field is not supported or for some other reason ,  an exception is thrown .  If the field is a ChronoField then the query is implemented here .  The supported fields will return valid values based on this month - day .  All other ChronoField instances will throw an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException .  If the field is not a ChronoField ,  then the result of this method is obtained by invoking TemporalField . getFrom ( TemporalAccessor )  passing this as the argument .  Whether the value can be obtained ,  and what the value represents ,  is determined by the field .

Constructs an ArithmeticException with no detail message . 
"Loads the native library specified by the filename argument. The filename argument must be an absolute path name. (for example Runtime.getRuntime( ) .load(""/home/avh/lib/libX11.so"" ) ; ) . If the filename argument, when stripped of any platform - specific library prefix, path, and file extension, indicates a library whose name is, for example, L, and a native library called L is statically linked with the VM, then the JNI _ OnLoad _ L function exported by the library is invoked rather than attempting to load a dynamic library. A filename matching the argument does not have to exist in the file system. See the JNI Specification for more details. Otherwise, the filename argument is mapped to a native library image in an implementation - dependent manner. First, if there is a security manager, its checkLink method is called with the filename as its argument. This may result in a security exception. This is similar to the method loadLibrary(String ) , but it accepts a general file name as an argument rather than just a library name, allowing any file of native code to be loaded. The method System.load(String )  is the conventional and convenient means of invoking this method."

"Parses the string argument as a signed long in the radix specified by the second argument .  The characters in the string must all be digits of the specified radix (as determined by whether Character . digit(char, int )  returns a nonnegative value ) , except that the first character may be an ASCII minus sign '-' ('\u002D' )  to indicate a negative value or an ASCII plus sign '+' ('\u002B' )  to indicate a positive value .  The resulting long value is returned .  Note that neither the character L ('\u004C' )  nor l ('\u006C' )  is permitted to appear at the end of the string as a type indicator, as would be permitted in Java programming language source code - except that either L or l may appear as a digit for a radix greater than or equal to 22 .  An exception of type NumberFormatException is thrown if any of the following situations occurs: The first argument is null or is a string of length zero .  The radix is either smaller than Character . MIN _ RADIX or larger than Character . MAX _ RADIX .  Any character of the string is not a digit of the specified radix, except that the first character may be a minus sign '-' ('\u002d' )  or plus sign '+' ('\u002B' )  provided that the string is longer than length 1 .

Creates a new view that represents an IMG element . 
Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered .  This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed .  For example ,  on a LocalDate ,  this could be used to set the year ,  month or day - of - month .  The returned object will have the same observable type as this object .  In some cases ,  changing a field is not fully defined .  For example ,  if the target object is a date representing the 31st January ,  then changing the month to February would be unclear .  In cases like this ,  the field is responsible for resolving the result .  Typically it will choose the previous valid date ,  which would be the last valid day of February in this example .

Creates a FieldPosition object for the given field .  The field is identified by an attribute constant from one of the Field subclasses as well as an integer field ID defined by the Format subclasses .  Format subclasses that are aware of Field should give precedence to attribute and ignore fieldID if attribute is not null .  However ,  older Format subclasses may not be aware of Field and rely on fieldID .  If the field has no corresponding integer constant ,  fieldID should be -1 . 
Sets the data for a single pixel in the specified DataBuffer from a primitive array of type TransferType .  For a ComponentSampleModel, this is the same as the data type, and samples are transferred one per array element .  The following code illustrates transferring data for one pixel from DataBuffer db1, whose storage layout is described by ComponentSampleModel csm1, to DataBuffer db2, whose storage layout is described by ComponentSampleModel csm2 .  The transfer is usually more efficient than using getPixel and setPixel .  ComponentSampleModel csm1, csm2; DataBufferInt db1, db2; csm2 . setDataElements ( x, y, csm1 . getDataElements ( x, y, null, db1 ) , db2 ) ; Using getDataElements and setDataElements to transfer between two DataBuffer/SampleModel pairs is legitimate if the SampleModel objects have the same number of bands, corresponding bands have the same number of bits per sample, and the TransferTypes are the same .  A ClassCastException is thrown if obj is not a primitive array of type TransferType .  An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException might be thrown if the coordinates are not in bounds, or if obj is not large enough to hold the pixel data . 
If a remaining element exists ,  performs the given action on it ,  returning true; else returns false .  If this Spliterator is Spliterator . ORDERED the action is performed on the next element in encounter order .  Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the caller .

Sets the focus owner .  The operation will be cancelled if the Component is not focusable .  The focus owner is defined as the Component in an application that will typically receive all KeyEvents generated by the user .  KeyEvents which map to the focus owner's focus traversal keys will not be delivered if focus traversal keys are enabled for the focus owner .  In addition ,  KeyEventDispatchers may retarget or consume KeyEvents before they reach the focus owner .  This method does not actually set the focus to the specified Component .  It merely stores the value to be subsequently returned by getFocusOwner ( ) .  Use Component . requestFocus ( ) or Component . requestFocusInWindow ( ) to change the focus owner ,  subject to platform limitations . 
Sets the image for this TrayIcon .  The previous tray icon image is discarded without calling the Image . flush ( ) method Â— you will need to call it manually .

Creates a delegate that implements MouseInputListener .  The delegate is added to the corresponding java . awt . Component listener lists at installUI ( ) time .  Subclasses can override this method to return a custom MouseInputListener ,  e . g .  class MyListUI extends BasicListUI { protected MouseInputListener createMouseInputListener ( ) { return new MyMouseInputHandler ( ); } public class MyMouseInputHandler extends MouseInputHandler { public void mouseMoved ( MouseEvent e) { // do some extra work when the mouse moves super . mouseMoved ( e); } } }
The user has activated the page up area of a scroll bar . 
Returns an array of unnormalized color/alpha components given a pixel in this ColorModel. The pixel value is specified by an array of data elements of type transferType passed in as an object reference. If pixel is not a primitive array of type transferType ,  a ClassCastException is thrown. An IllegalArgumentException will be thrown if color component values for this ColorModel are not conveniently representable in the unnormalized form. An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown if pixel is not large enough to hold a pixel value for this ColorModel. This method can be used to retrieve the components for a specific pixel value in any ColorModel. If the components array is null ,  a new array will be allocated. The components array will be returned. Color/alpha components are stored in the components array starting at offset (even if the array is allocated by this method ) . An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown if the components array is not null and is not large enough to hold all the color and alpha components (starting at offset ) . Since ColorModel is an abstract class ,  any instance is an instance of a subclass. Subclasses must override this method since the implementation in this abstract class throws an UnsupportedOperationException.
Constructs an instance of this class . 
Constructor for concrete subclasses; uses null for the default value . 
Invoked when the user attempts an invalid operation ,  such as pasting into an uneditable JTextField that has focus .  The default implementation beeps .  Subclasses that wish different behavior should override this and provide the additional feedback .

Does this transition represent a gap in the local time - line .  Gaps occur where there are local date - times that simply do not exist .  An example would be when the offset changes from +01:00 to +02:00 .  This might be described as 'the clocks will move forward one hour tonight at 1am' . 
Adds a point ,  specified by the double precision arguments newx and newy ,  to this Rectangle2D .  The resulting Rectangle2D is the smallest Rectangle2D that contains both the original Rectangle2D and the specified point .  After adding a point ,  a call to contains with the added point as an argument does not necessarily return true .  The contains method does not return true for points on the right or bottom edges of a rectangle .  Therefore ,  if the added point falls on the left or bottom edge of the enlarged rectangle ,  contains returns false for that point . 
Removes an attribute by name .  If a default value for the removed attribute is defined in the DTD ,  a new attribute immediately appears with the default value as well as the corresponding namespace URI ,  local name ,  and prefix when applicable .  The implementation may handle default values from other schemas similarly but applications should use Document . normalizeDocument ( ) to guarantee this information is up - to - date .  If no attribute with this name is found ,  this method has no effect .  To remove an attribute by local name and namespace URI ,  use the removeAttributeNS method . 
Constructs a COMM _ FAILURE exception with the specified detail message ,  minor code ,  and completion status .  A detail message is a String that describes this particular exception . 
Returns true if the socket is set to use client mode when handshaking . 
Creates a new sequential or parallel DoubleStream from a Supplier of Spliterator . OfDouble .  The Supplier . get ( ) method will be invoked on the supplier no more than once ,  and only after the terminal operation of the stream pipeline commences .  For spliterators that report a characteristic of IMMUTABLE or CONCURRENT ,  or that are late - binding ,  it is likely more efficient to use doubleStream ( java . util . Spliterator . OfDouble ,  boolean) instead .  The use of a Supplier in this form provides a level of indirection that reduces the scope of potential interference with the source .  Since the supplier is only invoked after the terminal operation commences ,  any modifications to the source up to the start of the terminal operation are reflected in the stream result .  See Non - Interference for more details . 
Returns a synchronized (thread - safe )  sorted map backed by the specified sorted map. In order to guarantee serial access ,  it is critical that all access to the backing sorted map is accomplished through the returned sorted map (or its views ) . It is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned sorted map when iterating over any of its collection views ,  or the collections views of any of its subMap ,  headMap or tailMap views. SortedMap m = Collections.synchronizedSortedMap(new TreeMap( )  ) ; ... Set s = m.keySet( ) ; // Needn't be in synchronized block ... synchronized (m )  { // Synchronizing on m ,  not s! Iterator i = s.iterator( ) ; // Must be in synchronized block while (i.hasNext( )  )  foo(i.next( )  ) ; } or: SortedMap m = Collections.synchronizedSortedMap(new TreeMap( )  ) ; SortedMap m2 = m.subMap(foo ,  bar ) ; ... Set s2 = m2.keySet( ) ; // Needn't be in synchronized block ... synchronized (m )  { // Synchronizing on m ,  not m2 or s2! Iterator i = s.iterator( ) ; // Must be in synchronized block while (i.hasNext( )  )  foo(i.next( )  ) ; } Failure to follow this advice may result in non - deterministic behavior. The returned sorted map will be serializable if the specified sorted map is serializable.
